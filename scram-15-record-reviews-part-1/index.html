				<p>SCRAM #15 Record Reviews<br>
all reviews by Kim Cooper except as noted</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Addrisi Brothers</b> Never My Love: The Lost Album Sessions<br>
CD (Var&egrave;se Sarabande) The Addrisis&#8217; &quot;Never My Love&quot;<br>
was such a smash for the Association that they got to go into<br>
the studio to try a record of their own in 1970.  The results:<br>
this charming, deliriously romantic California pop set, featuring<br>
Harry Nilsson on backing vocals. Arch, mannered orchestral fluff,<br>
brimming with rings in velvet boxes and vows of eternal devotion<br>
yeah, this one&#8217;s definitely for the girls.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Ann Beretta</b> New Union&#8230; Old Glory CD (Lookout!) Good,<br>
snappy punk rock of the Partisans/STF variety. Strong hooks, tight<br>
playing. The kinda band that you expect to pump out a full on<br>
assault at every gig, even if there&#8217;s only one audience member.<br>
And that guy will be skanking by himself at 70mph. I&#8217;m a sucker<br>
for stuff like this. (Margaret Griffis) </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Aqua Velvets</b> Radio Waves double CD (Milan) Crisp<br>
radio sessions from the long-lived Bay Area instro surf band,<br>
who throw together a stew of retro and more contemporary elements<br>
to create their signature swirling sound. A bonus EP recorded<br>
live in Mill Valley includes a whammy-damaged &quot;Smells Like<br>
Teen Spirit.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Arthurs</b> walking in the sunlight CD (Dirigeable)<br>
From Austin comes this appealing &#8217;67-style pop quartet whose debut<br>
is packed with catchy tunes and dreamboat harmonies. Doesn&#8217;t sound<br>
like they&#8217;re trying too hard, and they&#8217;re definitely having fun.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Autoliner</b> Be CD (Parasol) Lush, energetic pop trio with<br>
dense harmonies applied to pleasant little songs that remind me<br>
of the Jam when they&#8217;re not Cheap Trickish. Kinda lite metal in<br>
spots-is that the new power pop?</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Beachwood Sparks</b> once we were trees CD (Sub Pop) Hypnotic<br>
washes of chiming country rock, shambling, ambitious and warm.<br>
There&#8217;s a lot here, and it&#8217;s sounding more distinctly their own.<br>
I wish they played it straighter with the vocals, though-on the<br>
pretty songs it seems like they&#8217;re smirking.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Beacon Street Union</b> The Clown Died in Marvin Gardens<br>
180gm LP (Akarma) Pre-Partridge Family, superstar producer Wes<br>
Farrell oversaw these giddily ambitious Boston Sound-ers&#8217; 1968<br>
LP, rich with Oompah-Loompah orchestral washes, outta control<br>
guitars and snotty Prince Valiant vocals. The straight &quot;Blue<br>
Suede Shoes&quot; cover five years before the &#8217;50s revival is<br>
just plain weird, but a 17-minute &quot;Baby Please Don&#8217;t Go&quot;<br>
was definitely a good idea. Only on the added non-LP single does<br>
Wes team with Tony Romeo to actually write the group&#8217;s material-and<br>
it&#8217;s pure Partridge, natch!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Blow Up</b> &quot;Dead Stars&quot; +2 45 (eMpTy) Former<br>
Inhalants and Gimmicks hook up for a tuneful punkarama blast with<br>
extra tasty screams and rhythms snagged from grade school bullies.<br>
&quot;Black Lipstick&quot; highlights about 12 seconds of a sensitive<br>
side.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Blue &Ouml;yster Cult</b> S/T CD (Columbia/Legacy) Fine<br>
Long Island arcana from the nascent Cult, who having shed their<br>
failed East Coast Dead skin remade themselves as brainiac cycle<br>
goons. Batty lyrical contributions from Pearlman and Meltzer bring<br>
sci fi and pro rasslin&#8217; into the mix, but nobody would care if<br>
the band wasn&#8217;t a heavy metal machine capable of flights of grace<br>
abutting moments of terrorizing thud. Perversity never sounded<br>
so good.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Blue &Ouml;yster Cult </b>Tyranny and Mutation CD (Columbia/Legacy)<br>
Album #2 (1973). Side one (The Black) is heavy metal boogie aggro,<br>
sinister and plodding, the sonic equivalent of bugs picked out<br>
of a biker&#8217;s teeth. This stuff filled their live act for decades<br>
to come-and the bonus tracks here are live, with Buck Dharma taking<br>
a break from &quot;7 Screaming Diz-Busters&quot; to tell Seattle<br>
how he sold his soul for a record deal. The flip (The Red) offers<br>
artier melodic strains, including an early Patti lyric and the<br>
lovely &quot;Wings Wetted Down.&quot; Not their strongest set,<br>
but you can really hear the Cult identity taking form.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Blue &Ouml;yster Cult</b> Secret Treaties CD (Columbia/Legacy)<br>
Released on the cusp of their first headlining tour, Treaties<br>
is a demented delight, highlighting four prototypical B&Ouml;C<br>
themes: hysterical middle America rapo fantasy (&quot;Dominance<br>
and Submission&quot;), Nazi flyboy theme song (&quot;ME 262&quot;),<br>
freak portraiture (&quot;Harvester of Eyes,&quot; &quot;Cagey<br>
Cretins&quot;) and gorgeous pseudo-scientific romance (&quot;Astronomy&quot;).<br>
The band locked into a speedy groove overlaid with guitars crunchy<br>
enough to scratch your enamel. This might be my favorite Cult<br>
disc, and I&#8217;d recommend it for anyone wanting to start out with<br>
the reissues. It&#8217;s stoopid, weird, every song is great and it<br>
rocks like hell. Plus it&#8217;s got the most intriguing batch of bonus<br>
tracks, including a shockingly misogynist ditty called &quot;Mommy&quot;<br>
that somehow wasn&#8217;t released till now.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Blue &Ouml;yster Cult </b>Agents of Fortune CD (Columbia/Legacy)<br>
Their breakthrough record, sounding warm and bright. Yeah, &quot;Reaper&quot;<br>
is an astonishing single (musically and conceptually), but the<br>
album doesn&#8217;t quite work. There&#8217;s some terrific stuff here-&quot;This<br>
Ain&#8217;t the Summer of Love&quot; and &quot;E.T.I.&quot; especially-but<br>
also some tracks that are just hookless, and unworthy of the band.<br>
Where the songs measure up to the improved production you&#8217;ll find<br>
some of the Cult&#8217;s best moments, but don&#8217;t expect a straight-through<br>
listening pleasure. The bonus tracks are particularly interesting,<br>
with Buck Dharma&#8217;s home demo of &quot;Reaper,&quot; a song that<br>
later ended up on a Jim Carroll album, and a couple things derived<br>
from Patti Smith poems (though she doesn&#8217;t get her co-write credit<br>
on &quot;Sally&quot;).</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Boss Martians </b>Move! CD (Dionysus) Some tracks here<br>
highlight a cool new sound for the Martians, a soulful, hard-edged<br>
sixties r&amp;b groove with cheesy organ fills. Almost seems like<br>
a name change should be in order for a transformation like this,<br>
though hints of the old surfy Martians remain, and there&#8217;s plenty<br>
of car talk and echo. File under: transitional, and let&#8217;s keep<br>
an eye on &#8217;em. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Brian Jonestown Massacre</b> Braveryrepetitionandnoise<br>
CD (Bomp) Low key, hypnotic offering from Anton&#8217;s troublemaking<br>
clan, sounding this time out like a folksier Cult, with passing<br>
shards of T. Rex. Nice uncreditted and mistitled cover of the<br>
Cryan Shames&#8217; &quot;Sailing Ship.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Centimeters</b> The Lifetime Achievement Awards CD (Space<br>
Baby) The Centimeters have been spreading confusion locally long<br>
enough. Now the rest of the world can boggle to their utterly<br>
unique blend of new wave, German expressionism, homegrown weirdness,<br>
and of course Nora Keyes&#8217; demented kewpie doll act. Love &#8217;em or<br>
run screaming from the room, you won&#8217;t be able to ignore the Centimeters.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Chesterfield Kings</b> &quot;Yes I Understand &quot;<br>
b/w &quot;Sometime At Night&quot; 45 (Sundazed) The a-side is<br>
a jangly, catchy original reminiscent of the Kings&#8217; early waxings,<br>
though at 3:51 it runs long. The flip&#8217;s the Beau Brummels song,<br>
with Brums vocalist Sal Valentino guesting. While sounding more<br>
fragile, his remains a lovely instrument, and the backing is most<br>
sympathetic.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Chitlin&#8217; Fooks</b> S/T CD (Hidden Agenda/Palomine) Sweet,<br>
subdued California country rock duets from Bettie Serveert&#8217;s Carol<br>
Van Dyk and Pascal Deweze of Sukilove, accompanied by a passel<br>
of Dutch folks doing a convincing Fallen Angels act. The few originals<br>
nestle comfortably among the Burritos and Jimmie Rodgers covers.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Cold Blood </b>Vintage Blood? Live! 1973 CD (Dig) First<br>
official live release from the groundbreaking party funk band<br>
of the early &#8217;70s. Lydia Pense lead an eight-piece, horns-happy<br>
act through six albums that helped reshape the musical climate.<br>
As this set illustrates, Cold Blood knew their chops and were<br>
spirited musicians on stage. Pense is note-perfect throughout,<br>
but gives her group plenty of room to stretch out and shine on<br>
these five long songs. There are plenty of extended jam sessions<br>
to go around. Funky, soulful rhythms from the same era and general<br>
locale as Tower of Power. The bands also shared a similar sound.<br>
(P. Edwin Letcher)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Conflict/ Mortarhate</b> Only Stupid Bastards Help Go-Kart<br>
Records CD (Go-Kart) Understandably, I only got a sampler instead<br>
of all 14 CDs in the newly re-issued Conflict/Mortarhate catalogue<br>
(rats!) so instead of reviewing it, I&#8217;ll just blather on about<br>
the bands. As I recall, Conflict was second only to Crass in Anarcho-communist<br>
punk circles. Faster and harder, they were easier to grasp by<br>
hardcore, Oi, even metal fans than the artier Crass. Along with<br>
the ten albums originally released by Mortarhate come three CDs<br>
by various artists (Crass, chumbawamba, UK Subs) and the self-titled<br>
Icons of Filth. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Cripplers</b> One More For The Bad Guys CD (Dionysus)<br>
Rocking good country-junkie punk from Columbia, MO. Though not<br>
as heroin addled as most of their brethren, these fellas have<br>
shot up enough Heartbreakers to preserve Johnny Thunders for a<br>
few more years. Yet Missouri does not live by smack alone-the<br>
Cripplers spend just as much time cranked up on DMZ and occasionally<br>
dosing on SoCal superheroes Tex &amp; the Horseheads and the Flesheaters.<br>
The music sounds like it somehow breaks the speed limit heading<br>
to gigs in a disintegrating 40-year-old Ford. Serious whiplash<br>
warning. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Cyrkle</b> Red Rubber Ball CD (Sundazed) Brute Force<br>
fiends will want to pick up this reish of the Brian Epstein prot&eacute;g&eacute;s&#8217;<br>
debut for his two songwriting contributions-&quot;Why Can&#8217;t You<br>
Give Me What I Want,&quot; with its daffy harpsichord figure and<br>
phasing, and the punkily minimal &quot;There&#8217;s A Fire in the Fireplace.&quot;<br>
But there&#8217;s plenty more here to interest fans of sophisticated,<br>
well-arranged mid-sixties folk/pop, including almost another album&#8217;s<br>
worth of bonus tracks.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Cyrkle </b>Neon CD (Sundazed) The band continues to<br>
trot out perversities whenever you think you&#8217;ve got &#8217;em pegged<br>
as romantics. Compare the glistening Bacharach-David &quot;It<br>
Doesn&#8217;t Matter Anymore&quot; with the possible gag version of<br>
&quot;I&#8217;m Happy Just To Dance With You&quot; or the utterly lunatic<br>
take on Carol Bayer &amp; Toni Wine&#8217;s &quot;Problem Child.&quot;<br>
Whatever did the teenies make of these nuts? No Brute Force this<br>
time out, but how&#8217;s about a couple of flop singles covering the<br>
early Bee Gees? Neon was the last hurrah for the short-lived Cyrkle,<br>
its leaders making the switch to the more lucrative world of jingle<br>
writing, foreshadowed by their ad for Camaro, also included here.</p>

<p><b>David</b> S/T 180gm LP (Comet) Not to be confused with The<br>
David, this Canadian combo started in 1963 as The Marcatos, a<br>
rock-meets-TJ Brass bar band. Their one album was recorded in<br>
late &#8217;68, and is lovesick vocal pop with unusual arrangements,<br>
as when the horns call-and-response with electric guitar. They<br>
cover &quot;Hey Jude&quot; (nahhh) and &quot;House of the Rising<br>
Sun&quot; (cool). Kinda clunky, but certainly original. It did<br>
well on Canadian radio, where programmers were required to play<br>
a percentage of locally made music.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The David </b>Another Day, Another Lifetime CD (Jamie/Guyden)<br>
New stereo remix of the 1967 VMC album sessions by this interesting<br>
SoCal orchestral psych band. Strong original songs by Warren Hansen<br>
are set soaring by Gene Page&#8217;s ambitious string and horn arrangements,<br>
while punky fuzz guitar leads and thudding drums nestle alongside<br>
angelic harmonies. It sounds like it shouldn&#8217;t work at all, yet<br>
it does in surprising ways. With a couple of bonus tracks, including<br>
a wicked instrumental take on the Yardbirds&#8217; &quot;Mister, You&#8217;re<br>
a Better Man Than I.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Deadly Ones </b>It&#8217;s Monster Surfing Time CD (Collectables)<br>
Joe South seems to be the (horribly throbbing) brains behind this<br>
Southern fried surfsploitation platter, originally waxed for Vee-Jay.<br>
Monster sound effects and dialogue lend a Halloweeny air to what&#8217;s<br>
otherwise a solid set of moody instros, heavy on the twang.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Deadly Snakes</b> I&#8217;m Not Your Soldier Anymore CD (In<br>
The Red) Hot and twangy rock-n-roll by guys who love gritty psych<br>
blues and other beer chugging music incomprehensible to art school<br>
majors and goth types. They even have harmonica, organ and sax<br>
on this beauty. Hotter than a Texas rattlesnake sunning hisself.<br>
(Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Deep Reduction</b> &quot;2&quot; CD (Get Hip) Expect a fuss<br>
over this new collaboration by ex-Birdmen Deniz Tek and Rob Younger<br>
and the Stump Wizards. It&#8217;s full of the kind of raw, aggressive<br>
moodiness that Younger specialized in with the New Christs, but<br>
with a bluesier, more American feel. The excitement of hearing<br>
that voice and that guitar sound together again is undeniable,<br>
but it&#8217;s very much a group effort, with much of the songwriting<br>
by Wizards guitarist Jack Chiara. Potent stuff.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Dictators</b> D.F.F.D. CD (Dictators Multimedia) Twentysome<br>
years after Bloodbrothers, the Dics return with a long player<br>
on their own label that celebrates their city and all the trashy<br>
stuff they dig. Live faves like &quot;Who Will Save Rock and Roll?&quot;<br>
&quot;Avenue A&quot; and &quot;I Am Right&quot; sound tuff and<br>
cool finally captured on tape. I&#8217;m kind of put off though by a<br>
strain of bitterness and negativity running through the record,<br>
with &quot;Pussy and Money&quot; being the prime offender. I like<br>
these guys better when they&#8217;re not whining.<br><br>
The Dils Dils Dils Dils CD (Bacchus Archives) Were the Dils really<br>
commies? Were they even punks? At this late date, hardly anyone<br>
cares. They sure had a few great tunes, though. For completists<br>
only, this latest comp has their first surprisingly tuneful demos,<br>
the oft-heard Dangerhouse and Rogelletti 45s, and a ten sloppy,<br>
muffled live recordings from 1978-79, including the Velvets&#8217; &quot;What<br>
Goes On&quot; and &quot;Wreck of the Old 97.&quot; You shoulda<br>
been there.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Diplomats of Solid Sound </b>Instrumental Action Soul<br>
CD and &quot;Bullfrog Boogalo&quot; b/w &quot;Willie&#8217;s Theme&quot;<br>
45 (Prescription) From the ashes of Iowa City&#8217;s Bent Sceptors<br>
comes this funkily breezy Hammond groove combo. The ambitiously<br>
cinematic arrangements of their tight little tunes makes me wanna<br>
hear this with a dance floor nearby. Old school cool. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Dipsomaniacs</b> Stethoscopic Notion CD (Camera Obscura)<br>
From Norway (via an Australian label) come some deliciously dreamy<br>
psychedelia in a Younger Than Yesterday meets Green Pajamas vein.<br>
&quot;Bring Flowers to the Courthouse&quot; is more Beatles via<br>
Elephant 6. Hermetic, and highly crafted. &Oslash;yvind Holm has<br>
a peculiarly shrill voice that lends itself well to twining with<br>
the gorgeous instrumentation. Very fine stuff. I&#8217;ll be looking<br>
out for their earlier European-only releases.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Dirtbombs</b> Ultraglide in Black CD (In the Red) The<br>
prolific Mick Collins and pals rip through a set of old school<br>
soul and funk covers, with a one snotty garagy original to remind<br>
us that, for Mick, the concept of &quot;roots&quot; is broad indeed.<br>
Excitement, trash and passion.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>DMZ</b> live at the rat CD (Bomp) Live disk with eight songs<br>
from 1976, eleven from the 1993 reunion (of everyone but the rhythm<br>
section). The early stuff is brutal and delirious, a great mix.<br>
Monoman&#8217;s voice has lost a lot of its power over the years, but<br>
from the fan response it sounds like the &#8217;93 show was well received.<br>
Crazed, lewd and primitive punk-garage from the guys who conceptualized<br>
it. Don&#8217;t miss the ranting Monoman liner notes bagging on the<br>
CBGB&#8217;s scene and Sire Records&#8217; lousy coke.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Dogs</b> &quot;Class of 1970 &quot; b/w &quot;Rebel<br>
Rock&quot; 45 (Dionysus) The a-side&#8217;s a relentless new Dogs epic,<br>
celebrating old school lowlife pleasures to a jaw-clenching riff.<br>
Flip to hear the muddy sounds of the band playing in 1971, as<br>
captured on cassette.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Dream Syndicate</b> The Days of Wine and Roses CD (Rhino)<br>
Haven&#8217;t listened to this stuff in years, but time was they were<br>
&quot;my&quot; hometown band, so beloved I once missed the last<br>
bus rather than their set and walked home from west LA to Hollywood.<br>
It was worth it. When Kendra was in the band they had a mysterious<br>
alchemy that got into your bones and itched exquisitely. Never<br>
was the same after she split. Coming back to these songs via Bill<br>
Inglot&#8217;s crisp remaster, I marvel I ever argued &quot;hey, they&#8217;re<br>
not that Velvety&quot;-they were, and wonderfully primitive, and<br>
full of the kind of passion and pleasure and snotty confidence<br>
that&#8217;s still completely captivating. With the complete pre-album<br>
Down There EP, a couple of interesting lo-fi rehearsal takes,<br>
and the ultrarare Davis single by Steve Wynn&#8217;s Brit-damaged 15<br>
Minutes, including the original &quot;That&#8217;s What You Always Say.&quot;<br>
A recent live performance of the entire album (!) by Steve&#8217;s new<br>
band at the Hollywood Knitting Factory was transcendent without<br>
being more than ironically nostalgic. No one was really gonna<br>
meet Steve for Oki dogs after the show, but the crowd of fortyish<br>
Paisley Undergrounders and a smattering of savvy kids sure ate<br>
up the brittle, warm and affectionate sounds. Pure magic, with<br>
all the changes of two decades resting like a thin palimpsest<br>
over the beating heart of the original LP. Completely different<br>
from hearing it played first time around, but just as great.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Duotang</b> The Bright Side CD (Mint) Unusual stripped-down<br>
mod sound from this Canadian duo with no guitars but some deceptive<br>
bass parts. Clever and prickly.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Steve Earle, Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark </b>Together at<br>
the Bluebird Cafe CD (American Originals) You&#8217;ll wish you&#8217;d been<br>
in the room for this 1995 benefit concert for a Nashville charity<br>
dental clinic, one of the last times these three old friends got<br>
together to spin tales and share songs. All were in fine voice<br>
and spirits, with jokes flying fast between the great tunes. There&#8217;s<br>
a priceless Townes tale about gambling away his gold tooth. You<br>
get the sense of mutual respect and a bit of friendly rivalry<br>
between them as each trots out songs that are harder to top. &quot;I&#8217;ll<br>
see you one &#8216;Valentines Day&#8217; and raise you a &#8216;Pancho and Lefty.&#8217;&quot;<br>
We win.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Electric Eels </b>The Eyeball of Hell CD (Scat) 100%<br>
pure Cleveland bile and dada, circa 1975, with a bunch of unreleased<br>
stuff, including a wonderfully hateful &quot;Dead Man&#8217;s Curve,&quot;<br>
the original &quot;Agitated&quot; 45 and voluminous notes from<br>
the participants. It&#8217;s tough to take a whole CD of these guys,<br>
but you&#8217;ve gotta stand in open-mouthed awe at the sounds they<br>
were making and how early they were making them.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Enemies / Pitch Black </b>split CD (Lookout) Although noble<br>
in intent, split records don&#8217;t translate well into the CD age.<br>
In the old days of vinyl, you&#8217;d place the side you wanted to hear<br>
on the turntable and listen to the band you were interested in<br>
at the moment. Then, some other time (maybe even 16 minutes later),<br>
you&#8217;d listen to the other side gleefully, as if you&#8217;d purchased<br>
two LPs for the price of one. But with CDs, you have to deal with<br>
both bands being on the same side. One band always gets the bum<br>
deal of having all their songs at the end (unless you have the<br>
even worse scenario of mixing up the songs). Always get your split<br>
albums on vinyl if you have the choice. That said, split records<br>
do get a decent sampling of music out to the public. Both bands<br>
here hail from the East Bay punk scene. The Enemies are a metal<br>
tinged hardcore band with Dave Edwardson from Neurosis. Imagine<br>
the Descendents covering Black Sabbath-perky and poppy followed<br>
by dark and slow. Newcomers Pitch Black play the genre a little<br>
closer to SoCal. They apparently are jack-o&#8217;-lanterns, but don&#8217;t<br>
let their race sway you. Both bands play it hard and tight. (Margaret<br>
Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Evaporators </b>&quot;Honk the Horn&quot; 7&quot; EP<br>
(Nardwuar/ Mint) The Evaporators are rock and roll interviewing<br>
madman Nardwuar&#8217;s band, and this EP has something for everyone:<br>
several ebulliently silly and hopped up songs, a funny snippet<br>
of Nardwuar asking Tommy Lee if he bought or rented that notorious<br>
speedboat, and a printed history of the band&#8217;s van that magically<br>
takes exactly as long to read as the record does to play.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jad Fair &amp; Daniel Johnston</b> It&#8217;s Spooky CD (Jagjaguwar)<br>
Originally released in &#8217;89 on Fair&#8217;s 50 Skadillion Watts label,<br>
this is the sound of two na&iuml;fs goading each other to increasing<br>
heights of wackiness. Daniel gives vent to his prized obsessions<br>
(ghosts, Beatles, Roky Erickson), and Jad&#8217;s participation gives<br>
the whole scene the air of a folie a deux. Endearingly skewed<br>
melodicism, though the drumming is pretty annoying. Isn&#8217;t &quot;Tongues<br>
Wag in this Town&quot; a Dion McGregor dream? With bonus tracks<br>
and video footage.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mick Farren &amp; the Deviants </b>On Your Knees, Earthlings!!!<br>
1967-2001 CD (Total Energy) Anti-chronological career survey of<br>
Ladbroke Grove protopunk Farren and his varied compatriots released<br>
to coincide with Farren&#8217;s Random House memoir of the counterculture.<br>
Stray singles, album tracks and newly recorded oddities straddle<br>
the worlds of punk, psych and madman blues, and whatever the year,<br>
you can just tell these guys were smelly.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Fireballs of Freedom </b>Welcome to the Octagon CD (Estrus)Opens<br>
with hopped up grunge, more addicted to coffee and punk than metal<br>
and junk. Then again, maybe not. The slower tunes sound like the<br>
band&#8217;s run out of gas somewhere out in the hinterlands of Wash<br>
St. and copped some Oxycontin to pass the time with while waiting<br>
for Triple A. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Flute Force </b>eyewitness CD (innova) Classical music audiences<br>
notoriously fear and loathe contemporary classical music, which<br>
leads many concert programmers scrambling to find ways to reassure<br>
their audiences that new music can, in fact, be warm and friendly.<br>
Composer David Alpher could not have found a more soothing narrator<br>
for his eight movement work &quot;Land of the Farther Suns&quot;<br>
than Garrison Keillor, and it must play very well in Peoria, indeed.<br>
Kitsch-connoisseurs who read this here mag might be a little disappointed,<br>
however: it&#8217;s smarmy, but no more so than the sum of its parts.<br>
The rest of the music on the CD is fairly uninteresting to this<br>
jaded listener, the exceptions being the piece by flautist extraordinaire<br>
Robert Dick, who knows that a flute does not have to be nice,<br>
and a piece for flute quartet and string quartet by Eric Stokes<br>
which I found pleasant despite being inoffensive. The ensemble,<br>
Flute Force, handles it all quite well. But please, somebody stop<br>
them before they pun again. (Phil Curtis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Flying Fatal Guilloteens </b>The Now Hustle For New Diaboliks<br>
CD (Estrus) Tweaky guitars and scratchy vocals give the impression<br>
of good ole punk rock sloppiness, but listen closely and you&#8217;ll<br>
hear it&#8217;s well rehearsed and perfectly executed punk rock sloppiness,<br>
of the kind AmRep used to release. Interspersed between the driving<br>
rhythms are some nice subtleties that hearken all the way back<br>
to arty post punk. Good for people who simply wanna boogie and<br>
those too intellectual to get off the couch. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Edith Frost </b>Wonder Wonder CD (Drag City) Starts out<br>
all innocent and folky, building in intensity until the sweetness<br>
is cloaked in a medieval creepiness and starts sounding like the<br>
voices in a madwoman&#8217;s head. Ambling tunes reveal complex structures<br>
and compelling lyrics, with rather gorgeous results.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Fugazi</b> The Argument CD / Furniture CD-EP (Dischord)<br>
All right, I&#8217;ll admit it. I haven&#8217;t listened to a new Fugazi CD<br>
in years. Not really because I haven&#8217;t wanted to. I just gave<br>
up my record clerk job, moved to LA and discovered quarter LPs.<br>
(Sorry, prices have skyrocketed since then.)  As cheap as Fugazi<br>
CDs are, they couldn&#8217;t compete. Besides which, there was one LP<br>
a while back that I just couldn&#8217;t get into for whatever reason.<br>
Maybe it was the way that Nation of Ulysses jerk stared us down<br>
when he and Ian MacKaye sat down at our table at some show in<br>
DC. I don&#8217;t know if he was acting as bodyguard or just a toadying<br>
friend, but it really turned me off. I know you don&#8217;t always pick<br>
your friends, but it seemed a bit lame of Ian to hang out with<br>
intimidating poseurs, especially when I know those guys are nice<br>
and have a sense of humor. And we were sitting there first. But<br>
now I&#8217;m kinda sorry. If the last couple of CDs were as good as<br>
this one or the EP, I&#8217;ve been missing out. While retaining that<br>
trademark Fugazi sound, the character of the music has expanded,<br>
containing nuances from near and far in the musical spectrum.<br>
Some of it&#8217;s almost, dare I say it? Psychedelic and Beatlesque!<br>
I dig the faster tunes over the introspective ones, but that&#8217;s<br>
me. The slower tunes are just as good. I&#8217;d really, really like<br>
to hear this while driving down the Interstate right before a<br>
heavy rain, when the blackening clouds get thick and ready to<br>
pounce. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Holly Golightly </b>Singles Round-Up CD (Damaged Goods)<br>
Both sides of every single single Holly released between 1995<br>
and &#8217;99, from labels on several continents, which is almost certainly<br>
more than you&#8217;ve got in your jukebox. The styles range from Headcoatees<br>
raunch to the later busted up country folk sides, but it&#8217;s always<br>
pure Holly. Her highly personal chants of womanly woe make me<br>
think of ancient Greek heroines rending their hair and being roused<br>
to murder. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Margo Guryan </b>25 demos CD (Franklin Castle) &#8217;60s pop<br>
songstress Guryan wrote the luscious &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;<br>
(a hit for Spanky &amp; Our Gang) and plenty of sweet tunes interpreted<br>
here by her smoky whisper with electric piano accompaniment. There&#8217;s<br>
a period solo album called Take A Picture that I&#8217;ll pick up sometime.<br>
These simple recordings span thirty years, and give a good overview<br>
of her delicate, romantic sensibility shot through with shards<br>
of cynicism. The musical equivalent of hanging out in a rainy<br>
window seat with a pussycat.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>John Gilmore</b> Laid Bare CD (Amok) Gilmore, author of<br>
the Black Dahlia exploration Severed, has been quietly concocting<br>
this sonic tour of L.A.&#8217;s underbelly with the help of maestro<br>
Skip Heller and an impressive cast of associates, among them DJ<br>
Bonebrake, Robert Drasnin, Big Jay McNeely, Ray Campi and magician<br>
Teller on theremin. Dark tales unfold in a rough voice against<br>
a jazzy noir backdrop, as we visit with some of the criminals<br>
and art weirdoes Gilmore hung with in his decades on the scene.<br>
Good accompaniment for a road trip, provided you don&#8217;t scare easy.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Grains </b>&quot;Heart Full of Rain&quot; b/w &quot;Wait<br>
A While&quot; 45 (Teen Sound) Trad snot-nosed garage with a hint<br>
of the 13th Floor Elevators&#8217; electric jug on the flip. Bonus points<br>
for having a lead singer named Heino.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Guess Who </b>Shakin&#8217; All Over CD (Sundazed) Remastered<br>
from newly discovered master tapes are two dozen early tracks<br>
by the long-lived Canadian group. Their style veers all over the<br>
map, from Shadows-style twang to Kinksy rave ups, Beatlesque love<br>
tunes to an orchestral &quot;Flying on the Ground is Wrong.&quot;<br>
They may not have been particularly original, but they were inventive<br>
players who made the best of mediocre local studios. This non-chronological<br>
comp is a neat introduction to the many faces of the Guess Who.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Half Empties </b>Full Bore CD (Out of Step)Punkity rock<br>
heavily influenced by SoCal bands and English Oi, even a little<br>
Naked Raygun and Misfits for fun. Occasionally anthemic, mostly<br>
driving. Only some of the lyrics are printed, but I&#8217;m not sure<br>
for what effect. Good form, but lyricist could improve if he had<br>
a wider source of inspiration. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Hard Feelings</b> &quot;Soul Party&quot; 45 (Gearhead)<br>
Sloppy, slobbery trash-soul ravers originally waxed by Nathaniel<br>
Mayer and Solomon Burke, mixed by Raunch Hand Mariconda with suitably<br>
raunchy results.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Harpers Bizarre </b>Feelin&#8217; Groovy CD (Sundazed) Remastered<br>
debut from the frothy harmony popsters who might be the quintessential<br>
Warner Brothers art bubblegum band. Overseen by Lenny Waronker,<br>
the band highsteps their way through a gentle repertoire by Randy<br>
Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and Paul Simon.<br>
Bonus cuts: the Tikis WB single, from back when they were writing<br>
their own (less ambitious, garagey) songs.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Harpers Bizarre</b> The Secret Life Of CD (Sundazed) By<br>
album three, these cats were so deep into their dreamland that<br>
you half expect Little Nemo to guest star. The romantic, fanciful<br>
numbers, including several standards, are strung together around<br>
old-timey radio play interludes, resulting in a gesamptkunstwerk<br>
of sonic sunshine. This sounds like I remember Venice feeling<br>
in 1969. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Hives</b> Barely Legal CD (Gearhead) Powerful kitchen<br>
sink punk &#8216;n&#8217; roll as packed with political thinking as it is<br>
Ramones guitar. If you want one of those &quot;good&quot; headaches,<br>
pick this up pronto.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Ill Wind </b>Flashes 180gm LP (Akarma) 1968 Tom Wilson-produced<br>
debut for country-tinged Boston freak band. The Connie Devanney-sung<br>
tunes especially have an appealing spookiness. I guess after L.A.&#8217;s<br>
Standells made such a fuss about that &quot;Dirty Water,&quot;<br>
it was just a matter of time until a Bosstown band responded with<br>
something like &quot;L.A.P.D.&quot; Reissue has three extra tracks.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Immortal Lee County Killers </b>The Essential Fucked<br>
Up Blues CD (Estrus) Down and dirty, these guys sound like they&#8217;d<br>
like to party with the Pussy Galore-but not so much heroin and<br>
a lot more Alabama brand rotgut, &#8217;cause they&#8217;re nice boys. There&#8217;s<br>
only two of &#8217;em, but any more fellas would drink up all the booze.<br>
And the sound is full enough anyway without those whiskey swiping<br>
lazy assholes anyway. Who needs &#8217;em? Burp. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>IOWASKA</b> Vine of Souls CD (Alternative Tentacles) Pretty<br>
interesting release from what appear to be the crusty punks at<br>
a Rainbow Gathering &#8482; picnic. Quite a varied set of influences<br>
(Crass, Clash, Siouxsie, Black Sabbath among them) scrambled up<br>
into a dark psychedelic, metallic punk. Very Wiccan, yet angry<br>
as hell at all the usual victims of intolerant scorn: men, the<br>
system, Christianity, pollution, greed, circumcision. The high<br>
levels of estrogen will undoubtedly turn off some, but it&#8217;s definitely<br>
worth a spin. Street cred alert: Sam used to sing with the Amebix.<br>
(Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jack &amp; the Beanstalk </b>Cowboys in Sweden CD (Parasol)<br>
Crunchy guitars, catchy teenage melodies and some appealingly<br>
dumb lyrics on this Aussie/Swedish project. &quot;She Drives a<br>
Volvo&quot; sounds like a great lost Hoodoo Gurus track. Bonus<br>
live cuts include a Dictators cover.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Keepers</b> &quot;Stop Pretending&quot; +2 45 (Butterfly)<br>
This Irish combo has a chunky, summery sound that lends itself<br>
well to their cover of Bobby Fuller&#8217;s &quot;Lonely Dragster&quot;<br>
and two high-octane originals.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jeff Kelly</b> Indiscretion CD (Parasol) Solo project from<br>
the prolific Green Pajamas leader, heavy on the Catholic symbolism<br>
and his trademark longing melodies. I&#8217;m never fully convinced<br>
by his processed-sounding rock stuff, which is scattered throughout<br>
this release, among some quite pretty quieter pieces.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>King Brothers</b> S/T CD (In The Red) Heavy guitar rock<br>
in the grand tradition of VU, Led Zep, JSBX, but with the shitty<br>
production values of punk rock. You really have to listen to figure<br>
out that the stereo only sounds monophonic. I think the lyrics<br>
are in Japanese, but eerily sound like mumbledy English. The review<br>
so far only seems like I&#8217;m panning it, but the CD is pretty good,<br>
as is most of the In The Red catalog. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Knoxville Girls </b>in a paper suit CD (In the Red) Kid<br>
Congo Powers and pals could be the house band at some down-home<br>
haunted house, playing boozy, bluesy trash with a big old exposed<br>
and bloody heart (see esp. their goofball, &quot;Monster Mash&quot;<br>
take on the Shangri-Las&#8217; &quot;Sophisticated Boom Boom&quot;).</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Leaving Trains </b>Emotional Legs CD (Steel Cage) The<br>
Trains&#8217; first recording since the mid-&#8217;90s shows Falling James<br>
&amp; co. slipping easily from their unique brand of post-punk<br>
ire to a sweeter pop simplicity, with some old school punk and<br>
metal covers shared out along the way. Smart and sexy.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Les Incapables </b>&quot;1 2 3 4 Succes&quot; 7&quot; EP<br>
(Teen Sound) Francophone quartet from Montr&eacute;al play surfy<br>
and chaotic, like the party band in a mid &#8217;60s loony bin. Dig<br>
those organ frills on &quot;Twist-A-Rita!&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Les Sexareenos </b>Can You Do The Nose Mustache? 7&quot;<br>
EP (Telstar) Three Jim Diamond-recorded gems (+ one ringer) from<br>
these frenzied proponents of frat/Farfisa lunacy. Fast, fun and<br>
super snotty.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Les Slow Slushy Boys</b> Make Mine Slushy CD (Wildebeest)<br>
Compiling a bunch of these French revivalists hard-to-find Larsen<br>
and Butterfly releases. Some rockers, some gentle crooners, all<br>
with Teen&#8217; Axel&#8217;s wacky organ right up front.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Les Slow Slushy Boys</b> &quot;Zip-A-Dee Doo Dah &quot;<br>
+3 45 (Butterfly) Kicks off with a French-language slowpoke carnival<br>
organ take on the cartoon pop classic, followed by three originals<br>
enjoyably echoing the Merseyside stylings of Freddie and the Dreamers.<br>
Recorded dans Toe Rag, Londres.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jens Lindberg Meets the Strollers</b> 7&quot; EP (Teen Sound)<br>
Sounds like this meeting of the garage minds might&#8217;ve culminated<br>
in suicide, at least to judge by the sad sack gloom pervading<br>
these moody rockers. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Locust </b>Flight of The Wounded Locust CD (GSL)This<br>
is some fucked up shit. Devolved grindcore is what it is. At first<br>
glance, you get typical distorted speed-of-light hardcore, but<br>
then they have the gall to throw in keyboards and make it all<br>
sound &quot;weird&quot; like that. The nerve of them. How dare<br>
they?!? And to think they hail from out-of-the-way San Diego.<br>
Tampa Bay is more like it, but since the invention of airplanes,<br>
diseases have quickly spread around the globe. Eleven songs in<br>
just over ten minutes. I gotta have more. You hear me? One of<br>
the more interesting releases of the year. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Lost Sounds </b>Black-Wave CD (eMpTy) An evil new wave is<br>
emanating outta the south, sweeping up Jay Reatard and a passel<br>
of spandex-clad cronies. Psychotic synth pop with a fuzzed-out<br>
razor-sharp edge that&#8217;ll leave you dizzy and grinning. Nutty stuff!<br>
Only complaint: this kinda record should be precisely 28 minutes<br>
long, not 56.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mad for the Racket </b>The Racketeers CD (Muscletone) Punk<br>
elders Brian James and Wayne Kramer teamed up with various Blondies,<br>
G&#8217;n&#8217;Rs and Police for this sometimes shredding, sometimes bizarre<br>
debut. While some of the trad guitar ravers sound kinda rote,<br>
the best are just what you&#8217;d want from these guys, and the odd<br>
stuff is smart and enthused enough to keep your interest.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Roger McGuinn </b>Treasures from the Folk Den CD (Appleseed)<br>
Originally available as MP3s on McGuinn&#8217;s website, these 18 &quot;field<br>
recordings&quot; reveal the former Byrd hitting the road with<br>
his home recording studio to collaborate on folk and blues standards<br>
with artists like Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Eliza Carthy and Odetta.<br>
Judy Collins helps McGuinn revisit &quot;John Riley,&quot; in<br>
a version denser and more mystical than the Byrds&#8217; own. While<br>
some of the arrangements lack spark, overall this is an earthy,<br>
sincere meeting of old and new friends putting aside ego to celebrate<br>
the songs. The booklet includes McGuinn&#8217;s reflections on his visits<br>
with the musicians, and Jean Ritchie&#8217;s interesting letter about<br>
the derivation of &quot;Fair Nottamun Town.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Dan Melchior&#8217;s Broke Review</b> Heavy Dirt CD (In The Red)<br>
Swampy lo-fi punk-blues from this sometime Billy Childish collaborator<br>
and his Anglo/American combo, tastily steeped in Stooge riffage,<br>
garage rock sneer. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>M.I.A.</b> Lost Boys CD (Alternative Tentacles) Great classic<br>
hardcore that should be part of everyone&#8217;s collection. Punishing<br>
and fast, they were one of the mainstays in the punk acronym scene.<br>
Pretty good comp that includes tracks from the Last Rites for<br>
Genocide &amp; M.I.A. album and Murder in a Foreign Place EP.<br>
It also includes some tasty unreleased, live and rare stuff. Good<br>
for both the curious and the completists. In the words of one<br>
of my skater pals: crucial. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Millennium </b>Magic Time: The Millennium/Ballroom Recordings<br>
3-CD box (Sundazed) Break out the insulin before delving into<br>
this impressive collection of pretty much all the (non-Sagittarius)<br>
material put on tape by Gary Usher, Curt Boettcher and Keith Olsen<br>
during their late-sixties sunshine pop collaborations. Includes<br>
demos, scarce singles, unreleased rehearsals and instrumental<br>
backing tracks. Starting out somewhat hesitantly as The Ballroom,<br>
by the time of the Millennium&#8217;s Begin album they&#8217;d honed their<br>
preciousness to a candy-coated razor&#8217;s edge, drenched in studio<br>
artistry, made tougher by the session playing of former Music<br>
Machine members Ron Edgar and Doug Rhodes.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Montage</b> S/T CD (Sundazed) Post-Left Banke Svengali project<br>
from Michael Brown and a young band quite willing to submit to<br>
his Baroque requirements. The shimmery 1969 LP includes reworkings<br>
of the LB&#8217;s &quot;Desiree&quot; and &quot;Men Are Building Sand,&quot;<br>
the deliciously old-timey &quot;An Audience with Miss Pricilla<br>
Gray,&quot; and much harpsichord-soaked pop sweetness. While less<br>
effortlessly gorgeous than the Banke-the vocals sound like mere<br>
humans, not slumming angels-it&#8217;s a pleasant disk sure to please<br>
that band&#8217;s many fans. Includes informative notes by Richie Unterberger<br>
and four unreleased tracks.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>John Morton</b> Outlier: New Music for Music Boxes CD (innova)<br>
One way to set yourself off in a crowded marketplace is to have<br>
a gimmick. And despite the tiny audience, contemporary concert<br>
music is a crowded marketplace. Composer John Morton has found<br>
himself a promising gimmick: making music with music boxes (usually<br>
multiple boxes at a time, sometimes amplified and processed).<br>
And he does create some good pieces, simultaneously nostalgic<br>
and acerbic, occasionally pretty or mysterious. It is a little<br>
much for one sitting, though, sometimes feeling like you heard<br>
essentially the same thing a couple of tracks back. The one music<br>
box-less piece doesn&#8217;t really help matters much, and only makes<br>
the title of the disc less than entirely accurate. (Phil Curtis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Mullens </b>Tough To Tell CD (Get Hip) Standard late<br>
&#8217;70s power pop. Rough and tumble music that almost never colors<br>
outside the lines. The better songs borrow heavily from the early<br>
&#8217;60s. (Margaret Griffis)</p>
