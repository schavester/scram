<p></p>
<p><b>The Nads</b> &quot;Saigon Hooker&quot; +2 45 (Gearhead)<br>
Danny Nad&#8217;s strangled vocals lend an air of desperation to this<br>
crunchy set of Dead Boys-styled throb, on plummy purple wax.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Nectarine No. 9 </b>received transgressed &amp;transmitted<br>
CD (Beggars Banquet) Brainy, hypnotic Scottish anti-pop with Fire<br>
Engines and Pop Group connections. Thick spread with Joseph Beuys<br>
references, found snippets and gnawing melody lines that pull<br>
the whole thing taut yet let it throb. Pretty interesting.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Neu</b> 2 CD (Astralwerks) I tried Krautrock in my brief<br>
&quot;I dig everything&quot; phase, but picked up a lousy later<br>
Can album that soured me on the genre. Too bad I didn&#8217;t start<br>
with one of these hypnotic, rhythmic, wonderfully organic Neu<br>
records. It&#8217;s the sound of Neolithic robots preening themselves<br>
on an alpine lakeshore, while comets stripe the sky. Completely<br>
European, and always surprising, you&#8217;ll hear bits of garagey proto-punk,<br>
academic electronica, chants, elevator music, and a library of<br>
found sounds flowing together into a nutty, gooey slab that will<br>
make you think hard about how music works. Revelatory.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>New Town Animals</b> Is your Radio Active? CD (Mint)Spastic<br>
early UK type punk about important things like girls, sex and<br>
punk rock. The kind of music that makes everything you play for<br>
the next couple of hours seem morbid, dull and boring.  Opens<br>
with a very amusing &quot;radio track&quot; that includes Vapors,<br>
Buzzcocks and Generation X clips. I only wish that were the real<br>
state of radio. By the way, they apparently wear uniforms on the<br>
cover. Very good. Vancouver wins again. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>NRA</b> New Recovery CD (Gearhead) Popular Dutch punk vaguely<br>
reminiscent of Les Thugs on a SoCal / emocore bender. Takes a<br>
couple of listens before songs start to distinguish themselves,<br>
but otherwise a very strong release. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Orpheus</b> The Very Best of CD (Var&egrave;se Sarabande)<br>
From the mini-series of &quot;Boston Sound&quot; compilations,<br>
this one highlights the 1968-71 output of the soulful pop vocal<br>
act that did the other, other version of &quot;Walk Away Ren&eacute;e.&quot;<br>
Highly professional, with a slick Association-esque veneer and<br>
complicated string and brass arrangements. Classy without being<br>
particularly exciting, the sleepy vocals keep the early material<br>
from ever taking real flight; a late Bell 45 with second vocalist<br>
Steve Martin shows them stretching out into an intriguing heavy<br>
bubblepop sound.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Parker and Lily</b> Hello Halo CD (Orange) Sleepily western<br>
soundtracky pop shot through with mild bits of electronica, whispers<br>
and chimes. Pretty.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Pattern </b>Immediately CD (Lookout) Bay Area punk&#8217;s<br>
new hope, all yeah-yeah, woo-woo, snot-nosed swagger. Six-song<br>
sampler is sufficient to get your blood pumping and suggest that<br>
the whole thing would sound even better with sweat, beer, kids<br>
in the mix.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Armando Piazza (featuring Shawn Phillips)</b> Suan / Naus<br>
double CD (Akarma) Two albums of heavy, yet subtle, folky Italian<br>
psych with oddly inflected vocals and some deliciously crunchy<br>
guitar. Originally released on the Beautiful Black Butterfly label<br>
in the early &#8217;70s.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Pinkos </b>S/T CD (eMpTy) The &#8217;78 Clash color scheme<br>
of the sleeve alerts you that you&#8217;re in for a politicized punk<br>
outing from this prickly duo. Themes include feminism, hypocrisy<br>
and personal responsibility, and while there are moments of shrillness,<br>
Vanessa Vaselka&#8217;s sultry vocals and the group&#8217;s obvious sincerity<br>
make it worth a listen.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Pinkz </b>&quot;Something About You&quot; b/w &quot;Be<br>
Mine&quot; 45 (Gearhead) On hot-chacha pink vinyl comes this debut<br>
from Nikki Corvette&#8217;s sometime backing band, turning out their<br>
own sweet and sassy pop punk originals, seasoned with jungle drums<br>
and buzzsaw guitar.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Poison Control Center </b>The Go-Go Music Show CD (Bi-Fi)<br>
Delirious high-concept package with the least convincing British<br>
accents this side of Bangers &amp; Mash introducing PCC&#8217;s thrashily<br>
inventive bubblegum-pop. The eleven-piece band makes sure you<br>
get all the basic indie pop food groups, enhanced by electronic<br>
trickery, cooing girls, string and horn section, and, of course,<br>
musical saw.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Pram</b> Somniloquy CD (Merge) These remixes from the Museum<br>
of Imaginary Animals album yield jazzy constructivist dream pop<br>
with appropriately sleepy femme vocals. Think Nico doing the incidental<br>
music for some arty kid&#8217;s TV show. Nice. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Push Kings</b> Feel No Fade CD (Le Grand Magistery)<br>
Evolving over the course of two LPs from a stiff but agreeable<br>
Rubinoos-esque indie pop outfit to soulful mixmasters of modern<br>
pop stylings, this Boston-now-in-LA band is just too good to be<br>
ignored any longer. Imagine if the Backstreet Boys dropped Diane<br>
Warren from the payroll, and got some real, instead of suburban<br>
mall, soul. Imagine a modern power pop band not stuck in 1966<br>
(or &#8217;72, or &#8217;79). Imagine great pop melodies spiced up with splashes<br>
of doo-wop, trip-hop, funk and metal. &quot;The Minute,&quot;<br>
with its sweet harmonies and thundering guitars, sounds like the<br>
Osmonds rockin&#8217; the Warped Tour (if that sounds good to you, you&#8217;ll<br>
love this band). &quot;Summer Trippin&#8217;&quot; should&#8217;ve been the<br>
hot weather anthem of 2001 (well maybe next year). Pick this up<br>
and help AM radio pop bloom again in the 21st Century. (Keith<br>
Bearden)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians </b>96 Tears: The Very<br>
Best of CD (Var&egrave;se Sarabande) Don&#8217;t be misled by the title:<br>
this is not a legit reissue of the long-lost Cameo/Parkway albums.<br>
But it is a perfectly entertaining mix of recent rerecordings,<br>
plus a song from their live set at the first Cavestomp fest, and<br>
two newly unearthed 1966 demos. Since the Mysterians are still<br>
a delight, I ain&#8217;t complaining.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Radio Birdman </b>The Essential Radio Birdman (1974-1978)<br>
CD (Sub Pop) Radio Birdman is my favorite band. That their recordings<br>
have been unavailable in the US for twenty years is one of those<br>
ridiculous obscenities that first grates, and ultimately seems<br>
&quot;normal.&quot; The release of this intelligent and loving<br>
compilation reopens the wound, and I&#8217;m suddenly just as pissed<br>
as I was when, as a kid writing my first fanzine article, I railed<br>
against the unjust world that slammed the door on Tek, Younger<br>
&amp; co. This ain&#8217;t the place to catalog their accomplishments<br>
and tragedies-Vivien Johnson&#8217;s fantastic book does that at length,<br>
and David Fricke&#8217;s liner notes in brief. All you need to know<br>
is that they took a highly refined set of influences (Detroit<br>
&#8217;68, Jan &amp; Dean, B&Ouml;C&#8217;s metallic lyricism) and adapted<br>
them into a sound uniquely theirs, a sound which transformed Australian<br>
rocknroll and by rights should have changed the world. (I&#8217;m not<br>
exaggerating.) The power and beauty of this music is undeniable,<br>
as is its wit and playful intelligence. Sub Pop&#8217;s comp mixes up<br>
tracks from the early EP, both versions of the Sire debut, and<br>
their moody second album, plus a couple of live tracks, including<br>
the awesome &quot;Dark Surprise.&quot; It&#8217;s a fine introduction<br>
to the group. If you&#8217;ve never heard them and you love rocknroll,<br>
you owe it to yourself to pick this up. And heck, we&#8217;re giving<br>
away free copies to new subscribers, so what&#8217;s your excuse?</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Ramonetures</b> Johnny Walk Don&#8217;t Run Pauline CD (Blood<br>
Red) Mile high concept: X hits played Ventures-style, and with<br>
Billy Zoom and DJ Bonebrake enlisted for maximum whaaaa?? effect.<br>
Blame Phantom Surfer guitarist Mel Bergman, who previously filtered<br>
the Ramones through the same flaming V-shaped prism with equally<br>
nifty results. Less formulaic than you think: check out the exotica<br>
version of &quot;The Unheard Music&quot; with DJ going ape on<br>
the vibes, and Billy&#8217;s flute solo on &quot;Adult Books.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Red Planet</b> Let&#8217;s Degenerate CD (Gearhead) Eclectic sophomore<br>
effort from the lively Bay Area popsters throws some T. Rex, thrash<br>
and even britpop into the eau d&#8217;78 atmosphere but at the heart<br>
they still wanna be Van Halen, with a smidgen of new wave street<br>
cred. Featuring live faves like &quot;Continental Divide&quot;<br>
and &quot;You Knock Me Out,&quot; and more calls to teenies to<br>
drop their pants than on the Raspberries&#8217; Greatest Hits.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Resineators</b> Don&#8217;t ___ With the Fantasy CD (Siltbreeze)<br>
I wouldn&#8217;t have thought it possible for these two stoners to sound<br>
more obnoxious, and yet they&#8217;ve utterly surpassed themselves on<br>
this latest platter. Pick &quot;hit&quot;: &quot;Underage Girl<br>
(Get Out).&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Rocket 455 </b>Go To Hell CD (Get Hip) Detroit style rock<br>
that isn&#8217;t very inspired. Probably much better to see &#8217;em live<br>
than listen to &#8217;em in this posthumous release, but I won&#8217;t be<br>
afforded that opportunity. Actually, half the alternative music<br>
released since 1970 can trace it&#8217;s roots, attitude or poverty<br>
to the Stooges and MC5, but most of it at least tried to hide<br>
their debt (at least till everyone moved to Seattle) instead of<br>
flaunting it. I suppose it&#8217;s better to have an actual Detroit<br>
band mimic their history, but it&#8217;s still a bit tiring. (Margaret<br>
Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Royal Guardsmen </b>Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron/ Snoopy<br>
and his Friends CD (Collectables) Twofer comp of the Florida teen<br>
band&#8217;s first two Schulz-damaged Laurie LPs. Vs. salts a single<br>
Snoopy adventure among a standard set of frat rock covers, delivered<br>
with enthusiasm if not much distinction. The Friends on disk two<br>
are a bunch of unconvincing WWI foreign correspondents, narrating<br>
the action betwixt multiple barnstorming dog vs. baron scenarios.<br>
A couple of neat little love songs somehow sneak in too. It&#8217;s<br>
all completely ridiculous, yet somehow endearing.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Royal Guardsmen </b>The Return of the Red Baron/ Snoopy<br>
for President CD (Collectables) By album #3, the Guardsmen were<br>
clearly taking their pop pills and experiencing some consciousness<br>
expansion, though they&#8217;re still game to tackle &quot;I&#8217;m a Man&quot;<br>
and &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#8217;&quot; in raunchy style. The steel<br>
drum instrumental take on &quot;So You Want To Be A Rock &#8216;N Roll<br>
Star&quot; is a gem. &quot;Snoopy for President&quot; wraps up<br>
the Red Baron franchise by having the final wining vote for the<br>
doggy leader being cast by his one-time nemesis (apparently granted<br>
U.S. citizenship in one of those sleazy post-war rocket research<br>
deals). This is the disk to pick up if you need to hear the Guardsmen&#8217;s<br>
bubblegum, Bobby Goldsboro, Box Tops and Every Mother&#8217;s Son covers.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Satelliters</b> Sexplosive! CD (Dionysus) 100 years<br>
ago Darmstadt, Germany was a center for cutting edge decorative<br>
arts; today it&#8217;s home to the Satelliters, whose work is less original,<br>
but by no means unsatisfying. Their rearrangement of all the iconic<br>
elements of 1966 garage rock is tasteful and swinging, resulting<br>
in a sound you&#8217;d be happy to stumble upon in a basement dive in<br>
this or any decade.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Saturn V featuring Orbit </b>&quot;LCB&quot; 7&quot;<br>
EP (Teen Sound) Surfy San Francisco combo weigh in with four tunes<br>
for teenaged twisters. Fake Merseybeat collectors will want to<br>
tune in for their version of mocktop classic &quot;Mersey Mercy&quot;<br>
(aka &quot;You&#8217;ve Got Me Bugged&#8217;). </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Adam Schmitt </b>Demolition CD (Parasol) Apparently this<br>
fellow was one of those early &#8217;90s pop&#8217;s new hope types with a<br>
couple of records on Reprise. Having spent the last decade producing<br>
a host of Parasol acts and recording secret demos, here&#8217;s ten<br>
crunchy, catchy new songs sure to please the heart on sleeve brigade.<br>
Nice melodies, ringing guitars, and plenty of energy. Less predictable<br>
than many power pop records: there&#8217;s even some hard rock crossover<br>
action. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Screws </b>Shake Your Monkey CD (In the Red) Mick Collins<br>
and his latest combo trot out a raft of unexpected covers moving<br>
from garage (p)funk to blues to avant-shriek trippiness, with<br>
Terri Wahl&#8217;s crazy whine amping the tension whenever it appears.<br>
Post-everything sonics for the end times.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Sewergrooves &quot;</b>The Race is Over &quot; b/w &quot;Slave<br>
to the Sound of the Mellow Blues &quot; 45 (Gearhead) Adding some<br>
unexpected twists to the Norskpunk formula, &quot;Race&quot; is<br>
exciting and over just fast enough to leave you entirely satisfied.<br>
The flip&#8217;s got some moody Sonic&#8217;s Rendezvous things happening<br>
and a great sloppy break. Fun!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Shams</b> Take Off CD (Orange) These young Cincinnatans<br>
could almost pass for a Back from the Grave band, with their savage,<br>
swaggering (mostly original) nuggets and Jagger vox. The garage<br>
geeks are gonna cream all over this. A couple of Greenhornes guest.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Sick On The Bus</b> Set Fire To Someone In Authority CD<br>
(Go Kart) British Thrashcore with excessively paranoid lyrics.<br>
Naw, it&#8217;s not about how the First and Second World are fucking<br>
it up for the Third World, it&#8217;s all about how everyone else is<br>
an asshole not to be trusted. In fact, they printed explanations<br>
of their lyrics in case you didn&#8217;t pick up on the obvious messages.<br>
Even department stores can&#8217;t be trusted. They&#8217;ve put up cameras<br>
so you can&#8217;t steal anymore. And women. God forbid, you should<br>
involve yourself with a woman unless it&#8217;s for anonymous and brief<br>
sex. Now that we&#8217;ve determined how mindless everybody else is,<br>
the music is pretty good, cranked-up Motorhead, as indebted to<br>
metal as it is to punk rock. The British were always better at<br>
enjoying both genres combined than us colonials, which is maybe<br>
why the band felt they had to remaster and remix this American<br>
release from the debut album years after the fact. Nevertheless,<br>
it&#8217;s still hopping. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Simon &amp; Garfunkel</b> Bookends CD (Columbia/Legacy)<br>
Released in spring 1968, this ambitious self-produced set is a<br>
fascinating blend of sonic weirdness, indulgence (2:07 of old<br>
people talking?), art pop and the ace folk-rock of &quot;Mrs.<br>
Robinson&quot; and &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter.&quot; As an album<br>
it&#8217;s as chaotic and unfocussed as the year that spawned it, and<br>
about as intriguing. &quot;Fakin&#8217; It&quot; could almost be a lost<br>
Chad &amp; Jeremy track. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Simon &amp; Garfunkel </b>Bridge Over Troubled Water CD<br>
(Columbia/Legacy) When I was three, I thought the title track<br>
was the greatest song ever, even better than &quot;Octopus&#8217; Garden.&quot;<br>
None of the worldly sentiments meant a thing to me, but it could<br>
put me to sleep when nothing else could. Sounds kinda sappy now.<br>
Fortunately the album includes a few of their contrived rockers,<br>
but despite its popularity, there&#8217;s just not much here that&#8217;ll<br>
make your grown up jaw gape.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Simon &amp; Garfunkel </b>Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme<br>
CD (Columbia/Legacy) Mid-period S&amp;G romantica with some prime<br>
pretties and politics, but you&#8217;re gonna really flip for the faux<br>
Dylan goofiness of &quot;A Simple Desultory Philippic (Or How<br>
I Was Robert McNamara&#8217;d Into Submission),&quot; which abstracts<br>
the entirety of spring 1966 culture into a lean 2:19. Place it<br>
beside the version of &quot;Silent Night&quot; that&#8217;s accompanied<br>
by an increasingly terrifying newsread and understand that whatever<br>
the sixties were, &quot;groovy&quot; was the least of it.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Simon &amp; Garfunkel </b>Wednesday Morning, 3AM CD (Columbia/Legacy)<br>
Their first, and their folkiest. Dylan cover, Christian imagery<br>
(what&#8217;s up w/that?), a mawkish song for a fallen Freedom Rider,<br>
Simon&#8217;s original bit of bird-lore &quot;Sparrow&quot; showing<br>
what a wicked hand he already had with a melody, and those two<br>
voices working their Everlys-cum-Greenwich-Village magic. Juvenilia<br>
ain&#8217;t a bad thing.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Skooshny</b> Water CD (Minus Zero) Skooshny is an L.A. band<br>
that&#8217;s been (very) quietly plying their trade since 1971. If more<br>
folks knew about them, they could probably draw a tidy crowd,<br>
but of course they don&#8217;t play live. Now a collectable record shop<br>
in London has seen fit to release several disks of their subdued,<br>
Byrds-inflected wanderings. This is the latest, and shows Mark<br>
Breyer &amp; Co. continuing their gentle explorations in sonic<br>
layering and occasional flashes of jingly menace.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Slim Cessna&#8217;s Auto Club </b>Always Say Please and Thank<br>
You CD (Alternative Tentacles) Unironic C&amp;W complete with<br>
slide guitars, yodeling and Jesus. At least, I think it&#8217;s unironic.<br>
You never know with hipsters. But even if they think they&#8217;re being<br>
ironic, deep down inside they&#8217;re playing it closer to the heart.<br>
Mysteriously, or maybe not, as Nashville turned country music<br>
into just pop sung with a hick accent, hipsters (Dwight Yoakum<br>
and Palace for instance) managed to hang on to the flourishes<br>
that separate country from Top 40 schlock. And you knew the Rolling<br>
Stones were still cool as long as they partied south of the Mason-Dixon<br>
line. So it should come as no surprise that Alternative Tentacles<br>
has put out one of the best country music releases in years. Beholden<br>
to the Dead Kennedys and Nick Cave as much as they are to any<br>
old hillybilly, these guys know how to shake the cowshit off your<br>
britches. And don&#8217;t forget that even in the olden days of Hank<br>
Williams and Bill Monroe they knew how to drop a funny lyric here<br>
and there. In a just world, they&#8217;d be the house band on Hee-Haw.<br>
(Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Spits</b> S/T CD (Nickel &amp; Dime) Wow! I&#8217;m having<br>
some kind of flashback. These guys sound exactly like some nowheresville<br>
hardcore band from way back in the early &#8217;80s, the kind you&#8217;d<br>
find stuck towards the end of a Flipside compilation. So many<br>
questions. Did they record this on a boombox? Is that an organ?<br>
Is this a re-release? And their look! You have to see the cover.<br>
What&#8217;s up with those moustaches? Are they cops? Are they nazis?<br>
 Are they dweebs? Are they capable of creating bombs and drugs<br>
in a lab? Do they really skate? I&#8217;m completely hypnotized by this.<br>
They seem to be inspired by both DEVO and GG Allin. Very weird<br>
in its uncoolness. I like it! (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Stoneground</b> The Last Dance, Recorded Live January 6,<br>
1973 CD (DIG) After the Beau Brummels split up for the first time,<br>
Sal Valentino took his velvet pipes home to San Francisco to front<br>
this 11-person boogie band manufactured by DJ Tom Donahue for<br>
the Medicine Ball Caravan film. Not quite the Monkees, Stroneground&#8217;s<br>
soulful groove made them a prime live attraction during their<br>
brief existence. This clean-sounding disk documents their final<br>
appearance before a sold-out Sacramento house, and suggests that<br>
there was still plenty of life in them. There&#8217;s a bit too much<br>
choogling in spots, but when Sal lets loose on a Hardin/Dylan<br>
medley, mmmm it&#8217;s sweet.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Strokes</b> Is This It CD (RCA) Cripes, what&#8217;s the fuss?<br>
Lively, nervous post-punk with New Values-era Iggy vox. It sounds<br>
like real rock and roll, and kids are buying it. This is not a<br>
bad thing, so quit yer bellyachin&#8217;.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Syphlloids</b> Finger Check CD (Etiquette) Good band with<br>
purposefully silly/bad lead singer. Infantile sensibilities-porno<br>
starlets, girls too pretty to pay them mind and girls who won&#8217;t<br>
screw them-like a third rate SoCal punk band from the mid-&#8217;80s.<br>
(Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Two Man Advantage</b> Don&#8217;t Label Us CD (Go-Kart) Fun hardcore<br>
from a band that, well, has a fascination for hockey that hasn&#8217;t<br>
been seen since the Hanson Brothers. They even have team jackets!<br>
Precious. But don&#8217;t be distracted, this is some rocking stuff.<br>
(Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Tyme Society</b> &quot;Leaves Are Turnin&#8217; Brown &quot;<br>
b/w &quot;Wonderin&#8217; Why&quot; 45 (Psych-Out) Fronted by Misty<br>
Lane magazine honcho Mass, these five Italian psych fiends offer<br>
sensitive original organ-fueled folk punkers that make up in gloom<br>
what they lack in the letter &quot;G.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Ultimate Spinach </b>The Very Best of CD (Var&egrave;se<br>
Sarabande) Selections from the Boston psych band&#8217;s three MGM albums<br>
and an atypically punky late 45 cover of &quot;Just Like Romeo<br>
and Juliet.&quot; The albums were classically tinged weirdness<br>
with theremin, sitar and not enough of Barbara Hudson&#8217;s spaced-out<br>
acid goddess vocals. Leader Ian Bruce-Douglas was pushed out of<br>
the band within a year, yielding a second incarnation featuring<br>
Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter and other members of Chameleon Church,<br>
but no songs. Self-indulgent, but entertainingly trippy in spots.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>The Best of the Boston Sound CD (Var&egrave;se Sarabande)<br>
Long before Seattle was invaded by carpetbagger A&amp;R execs<br>
in crisp new flannels, Boston swarmed with their headbanded antecedents.<br>
The kids weren&#8217;t buying in 1968, either. Compiling tracks by 18<br>
of the Boston-area bands that were either part of MGM&#8217;s Boston<br>
Sound promotion or signed in its aftermath, this collection offers<br>
an archeological overview of a scene that wasn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s not<br>
much connection beyond the regional between Orpheus&#8217; soft soul-pop<br>
and the cantankerous thud of Phluph, Beacon Street Union&#8217;s loony<br>
Wes Farrell-produced bubbleart and Earth Opera&#8217;s expansive Americana.<br>
Not fitting thematically, but nice to have, are Bead Game&#8217;s hard-to-find<br>
&quot;Sweet Medusa&quot; from the soundtrack to The People Next<br>
Door, and the Rockin&#8217; Ramrods&#8217; classic 1966 single &quot;Bright<br>
Lit Blue Skies.&quot; </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> Better Than The Beatles: A Tribute To The Shaggs<br>
CD (Animal World) Some bands lend themselves easily to tribute<br>
albums-and surprisingly enough, the Shaggs are among them. The<br>
thirteen acts involved, including the Thinking Fellers, Danielson<br>
Familie and Optiganally Yours, transform their obvious affection<br>
for Dorothy Wiggins&#8217; loopy originality into a different kind of<br>
folk art, more knowing but still steeped in charm. Bauer&#8217;s &quot;We<br>
Have A Savior&quot; is a mini-symphony, Deerhoof&#8217;s &quot;My Pal<br>
Foot Foot&quot; is deliriously robotic, while Danielson&#8217;s &quot;Who<br>
Are Parents&quot; goes completely over the top with the baby talk.<br>
Fun!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Chinese Checkers: A Tribute to Memphis Soul Instrumentals<br>
CD (Wildebeest) Instro outfits from at least a couple of continents<br>
join together to praise the MGs &amp; associates in this affectionate<br>
tribute. More surf than soul, with contributors including the<br>
Tikitones, Waistcoats and Sir Finks. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Give the People What We Want: Songs of the Kinks<br>
CD (SubPop) And who doesn&#8217;t love the Kinks? A who&#8217;s who of Northwest<br>
bands tackles faves mostly from the Davies&#8217; first decade, some<br>
playing it straight, others deconstructing things neatly. Highlights<br>
include Mark Lanegan&#8217;s drowsy &quot;Nothin&#8217; In the World Can Stop<br>
Me Worryin&#8217; Bout That Girl,&quot; the Fallouts&#8217; trad take on &quot;This<br>
Man He Weeps Tonight,&quot; and Heather Duby&#8217;s cooing &quot;The<br>
Way Love Used to Be.&quot; Plus: the Fastbacks, Mudhoney, Young<br>
Fresh Fellows, Minus 5.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Gulliver&#8217;s Travels featuring Mike D&#8217;Abo CD (Instant)<br>
This messy Immediate LP from February 1969 is a patchwork of stolen<br>
sound (including excerpts from Zodiac Cosmic Sounds!), swirling<br>
synths, drunken mockery of the Small Faces, and somewhere in the<br>
mix a few flecks of narrative from Swift. Stoned and silly, it&#8217;s<br>
not particularly musical, but there&#8217;s definitely historic value<br>
in the prototypical sampling. The project originated in a stage<br>
play the previous year, and the poppiest thing here is its failed<br>
single, quickly withdrawn when Manfred Mann sent his solicitors<br>
around. (D&#8217;Abo was still with the Manfreds at the time.)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Halleluja: Gospel &amp; Prayers 1926-1946 CD (Trikont)<br>
If you&#8217;re not squeamish about Christian themes, the powerful voices<br>
and rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll energy on this fifth volume of Trikont&#8217;s ever-interesting<br>
Flashbacks series will give you the chills. Featuring Bessie Smith,<br>
Sister Rosetta Tharpe and a bunch of true believers.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Have Narghile: Turkish Rock Music 1966 to 1975 CD<br>
(Bacchus Archives) Weird and rather wonderful compilation of Turkish<br>
bands and solo performers who mixed traditional rhythms and melodies<br>
with Western pop influences. There&#8217;s some wild psych here-check<br>
out the vicious guitar on Erkin Koray &amp; Ter&#8217;s sole 1972 single-among<br>
many moments of crossover oddness. Apparently mastered from less-than-pristine<br>
vinyl, but where else are you gonna find this stuff?</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> Les Chansons des Perverts CD (Crippled Dick) Offbeat<br>
mix of historic and contemporary recordings occupying the sleazy<br>
side of the street. Panting Mystic Moods rub up against Tony Bruno<br>
motorcycle operas, Earl Wilson&#8217;s Let My People Come musical makes<br>
friends with Seksu Roba. Libidinous, yet goofy, just like you.
</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British<br>
Empire and Beyond, 1964-1969 4-CD boxset (Rhino) In a break from<br>
the Americana bent of the first Nuggets box, this time the focus<br>
is on UK freakbeat, the Continent and beyond far beyond. I don&#8217;t<br>
care what anyone says, &quot;Tokyo&#8217;s&quot; Mops are obviously<br>
from Mars. The four disks are crammed with prime obscurities and<br>
a few stray hits from a United Nations of moptops. From Black<br>
Beauty-scented rave-ups to acid-drenched dreams, there&#8217;s probably<br>
a dozen things here you&#8217;ve never heard and will flip over. Other<br>
stuff you already have, but in much lower fidelity on dodgy comps.<br>
And if the sequencing isn&#8217;t always of optimum mix-tape quality,<br>
you can always burn your own version. Comes with a gorgeous, full-color<br>
100 page book filled with rare band pix, record sleeves, Mike<br>
Stax&#8217; track notes and useful introductions from Greg Shaw, and<br>
fellow compilers Alec Palao and Gary Stewart.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Poet: a tribute to Townes Van Zandt CD (FreeFalls)<br>
Townes was a songwriter&#8217;s songwriter, and the respectful group<br>
who f&ecirc;te him here seem disinclined to deviate much from<br>
his arrangements. So what you get are those marvelous songs, the<br>
sad ones rather than the silly, sung by some of the finest singer-songwriters<br>
around. Lucinda Williams&#8217; beautifully hopeless take on &quot;Nothin&#8217;&quot;<br>
is the standout. Son John T. Van Zandt closes the proceedings<br>
sounding eerily like his dad. In between Steve Earle and the Dukes<br>
rip up &quot;Two Girls,&quot; the reformed Flatlanders offer a<br>
lovely &quot;Blue Wind Blew,&quot; Nanci Griffith&#8217;s &quot;Tower<br>
Song&quot; is icily moving, and Willie Nelson turns to &quot;Marie,&quot;<br>
Townes&#8217; best late song, the one that used to make people cry and<br>
give money to beggars on their way out of the show. A classy,<br>
respectful release with uniformly fine performances. My friend<br>
Lisa let me help her with her Grammy votes, so we cast one for<br>
this.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Popshopping 2: More Music from German Commercials<br>
1962-1977 CD (Crippled Dick) Wonderfully bats reclaimed advertmusik<br>
teeming with joyous choruses, fake funk, fuzz guitars, lonesome<br>
strings and the occasional mysterious exclamation of delight.<br>
I dunno what these cats were selling, but gimme one of each.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A </b>Where the Girls Are Volume 4 CD (Ace) Ace digs still<br>
deeper into the vaults for this latest installment of their girl<br>
group rarities comp. Drawing on the Atlantic/Atco singles catalog<br>
(including French and UK releases), WTGA4 draws a swinging portrait<br>
of the teenage heart circa 1962-66 with the enthusiastic aid of<br>
assorted Cookies, Gingerbreads, Bobbettes and Bluebelles.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Varuckers</b> How Do You Sleep? CD (Go-Kart) The Varuckers<br>
have been around for close to forever but are still almost unknown<br>
in the US, where the trickle of imports are quickly snatched up<br>
by their crusty fans. I believe this is their first product released<br>
in Amerikkka, which is a shame because it&#8217;s a pretty good CD.<br>
It&#8217;s Metallish punk with great lyrics accurately parodying the<br>
usual Anarcho-communist topics like begging not to be forced into<br>
doing anything for the corporations and forcing the corporations<br>
to do everything for them. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Loudon Wainwright III</b> Last Man on Earth CD (Red House)<br>
He&#8217;s been around for decades, a singer-songwriter with one novelty<br>
hit (&quot;Dead Skunk&quot;) and a minor reputation as a darkly<br>
wacky &quot;new Dylan&quot; who hasn&#8217;t had an American major label<br>
deal for years. He has been married, divorced, had kids who he<br>
doesn&#8217;t see much anymore, both parents dead, facing life after<br>
50 with doubtful accomplishments to look back on and thickening<br>
darkness ahead. With a bravery that&#8217;s sometimes startling, he&#8217;s<br>
spun pure gold out of this coal-lump of a situation on his new<br>
album, a beautifully constructed and throat-tighteningly sad meditation<br>
on what it&#8217;s like to be that 53-year-old man. He doesn&#8217;t let up<br>
one bit-every little detail of being alone and lonely and haunted<br>
by ghosts is laid on the table. Even the obligatory &quot;life<br>
goes on&quot; chins-up he indulges in on occasion are transparently<br>
phony and ineffectual, a writer not fooling himself, much less<br>
his audience. The melodies are strong, the musical backing refined<br>
and right, the words smart, apt, detailed, and completely dispiriting.<br>
It&#8217;s a folk-rock opera of late middle-aged bourgeois disaffection,<br>
about missing your mom, feuds with your dad, the uncertainty of<br>
friendship and the depressing and empty residue of past romances.<br>
This is first unstintingly truthful assessment of life past 50<br>
by a pop songwriter yet. Given demographic realities, maybe it&#8217;ll<br>
presage a trend. Fuck Jethro Tull, this is the sad truth about<br>
being too old to rock n&#8217; roll, too young to die. (Brian Doherty)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Wanna-Bes</b> ST CD (Panic Button) Very, very heavy<br>
Ramones / Bad Religion rotation on the Wanna-Bes&#8217; turntables-to<br>
a distracting degree, actually. Play the guitar tracks alone and<br>
I don&#8217;t think Johnny Ramone could tell they weren&#8217;t his. I guess<br>
if you grew up with that Seattle sound, you&#8217;d do anything to sound<br>
different. I don&#8217;t blame &#8217;em. I&#8217;m tired of grunge too, but the<br>
Wanna-Bes are a little too much. So this begs the question: if<br>
the Ramones aren&#8217;t around anymore, are you better off buying their<br>
old records or supporting the current scene? It&#8217;s tough because<br>
you might miss out on some of the best records of all time in<br>
either case. But the Ramones are about as timely today as the<br>
Stooges were in 1991. And it ain&#8217;t a scene if you&#8217;re shut inside<br>
your time capsule, which is where we find the Wanna-Bes. They<br>
wanna be back in 1976, but it&#8217;s 25 years later and the Ramones<br>
are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, not in the new bins. Their<br>
CD isn&#8217;t as good as just about all of the Ramones&#8217; catalog, but<br>
to dismiss them outright seems equally shameful. There&#8217;s talent<br>
here, you can hear it clearly in the power pop singles, but it&#8217;s<br>
misdirected. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Warlocks</b> Rise and Fall CD (Bomp) Loud, often rough<br>
and VU-inspired, on record this stuff actually has the head-butt<br>
intensity their proponents claim for them. Completely reductive,<br>
but in a good way, with moments of real ice queen prettiness.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Peter Warren &amp; Matt Samolis </b>Bowed Metal Music CD<br>
(innova) This is one of those one of those times that I wish that<br>
I had heard Metal Machine Music, so that I might here make a sly<br>
comparison. However, I&#8217;m pretty sure that if you dig MMM, you&#8217;ll<br>
dig this as well. The title pretty much tells you what you need<br>
to know: it&#8217;s music produced by vibrating metal plates and cymbals<br>
with bows. It&#8217;s a beautiful sound if you&#8217;re into that sort of<br>
thing, and the performance here has a sort of trajectory to it.<br>
Quite the religious experience, actually, if approached with the<br>
proper frame of mind. (Phil Curtis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Weird Lovemakers</b> Live: Bigger Than A Cookie, Better<br>
Than A Cake CD (eMpTy) Tight and crunchy, totally great band from<br>
another planet named Albuquerque, NM. You can tell that not much<br>
goes on in &#8216;querque &#8217;cause these guys obviously have plenty of<br>
time to spend crafting their tunes. The results are kickass. Supposedly,<br>
this is a live show, but it barely sounds as if they have the<br>
&quot;live filter&quot; turned on, let alone are playing in front<br>
of people. Unless no one was there. Like all good punk, lyrics<br>
are barely understandable, but you kinda sense they might be good.<br>
Music is pinched-nerve, head-shakin&#8217; good as well. Hell, if they<br>
sound this good playing in front of nobody, they should come to<br>
LA where they can play in front of lot of nobodies and me. (Margaret<br>
Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Wendy &amp; Bonnie</b> Genesis CD (Sundazed) This is one<br>
of those things so perfectly matched to a certain geekoid demographic<br>
that it&#8217;s tough to believe it&#8217;s real. Two nubile San Francisco<br>
sisters, circa 1968, unleashed an album of shimmery Brazilian-inflected<br>
soft pop originals for the jazzy Skye label. The label went under,<br>
and the record was barely heard. Revived with bonus tracks, Genesis<br>
is a charming, surprisingly mature confection, studded with tasteful<br>
session work and the girls&#8217; own prodigious playing. While not<br>
as amazing as some reviewers would have you believe, it&#8217;s a very<br>
pleasant and surprising record, sure to appeal to sixties pop<br>
aficionados.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band </b>Vol. 2 CD (Sundazed)<br>
This is the first of their records I heard, via a 25-cent German<br>
copy scored when the Rhino parking lot sale still yielded such<br>
treats, and it&#8217;s still my fave. A blackly glowing concept album<br>
about the Vietnam War and sex with underaged Sunset Strip habitu&eacute;s,<br>
it also features &quot;Smell of Incense,&quot; the loveliest thing<br>
they ever put to wax. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band</b> Vol. 3: A Child&#8217;s<br>
Guide to Good &amp; Evil CD (Sundazed) The stripped-down WCPAEB<br>
trio of Shaun Harris, Ron Morgan and weirdo Bob Markley deliver<br>
their final Reprise album, a freaked out blend of psychedelic<br>
prettiness, antiwar cries, and interband conflict manifested as<br>
cynical riffs on the hippie ethic. Obnoxious as Markley undoubtedly<br>
was, he could come up with some pretty wild lyrics: &quot;A vampire<br>
bat will suck blood from our hands/ A dog with rabies will bite<br>
us/ Rats will run up your legs/ But nothing will matter.&quot;<br>
Fascinating and creepy.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Witches</b> Universal Mall CD (Fall of Rome) Interesting<br>
Detroit combo who keep you guessing with their garage-pop-psychedelic<br>
stew, held loosely in check by producer Jim Diamond. Undisciplined,<br>
but appealing.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Woggles </b>Live! At the Star Bar CD (Blood Red) Hometown<br>
gig from September 2000 shows the perpetual party band in high,<br>
sweat-soaked dudgeon as they crank through two dozen good excuses<br>
to order another beer.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Steve Wynn </b>Here Come the Miracles double CD (Innerstate)<br>
Heading out to the desert with Chris Cacavas was an inspired move<br>
for Wynn. Not since first-wave Dream Syndicate has he sounded<br>
so in love with his band, the emotional environment he apparently<br>
needs to tap into magic places. Miracles is two disks of tough,<br>
moody rockers seeped in West Coast mythology and a strong shot<br>
of heartbreak. Track 3 (&quot;Sustain&quot;) is about as close<br>
to perfection as a pop song needs to be these days, but the record&#8217;s<br>
strong throughout. Recommended, and even better live.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Yesterday&#8217;s Kids</b> Everything Used To Be Better CD (Panic<br>
Button) The songs are well written pop. The music&#8217;s well played<br>
if a bit derivative. Lots of potential &quot;hit&quot; singles<br>
here. My main complaint here is the vocal stylings. I don&#8217;t know<br>
why, but altogether too many punk singers nowadays have that same<br>
deadpan delivery. You know it when you hear it. Like an uncynical<br>
10-year-old kid, who is trying to pretend he&#8217;s not singing. Where<br>
the hell did that originate? Gilman Street? Which is a shame,<br>
&#8217;cause otherwise I&#8217;d like this a lot. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p><b>Zakary Thaks</b> Form the Habit CD (Sundazed) One of the<br>
finest regional garage bands of the sixties, Corpus Christi&#8217;s<br>
Thaks could write their own rave ups or make a Kinks cover their<br>
own. Best known for tough stuff like &quot;Bad Girl&quot; and<br>
&quot;Face to Face,&quot; they also played nice and dished out<br>
the harmonies when inclined. This crisp-sounding disk compiles<br>
their J-Beck, Thak and Cee-Bee singles with several previously<br>
unreleased cuts. Check out the patricidal &quot;Can You Hear Your<br>
Daddy&#8217;s Footsteps&quot;-yow, nuts!<br></p>
