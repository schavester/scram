<p><b>The Alphabet <i>when the sun calls your name or, Ghost World</i></b><br>
CD (Nashinal Sound Recordings) This set of mostly solo poppy psych<br>
produced by John Nash in his Detroit bedroom is one of the records<br>
that fell through the cracks when Poptones folded. The appealing<br>
tunes are dressed up with trippy homegrown effects. Playful, earnest,<br>
and pleasantly uncool.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Phil Angotti and the ideas <i>Flower Bomb</i></b> CD (JAM)<br>
High-energy jangly pop, with clever songs and lovely shimmery<br>
harmonies. Includes nifty tributes to mopester pin ups Nick Drake<br>
and Colin Blunstone.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005YEPR/bubblegumbook"><b>The Bards <i>Resurrect &quot;The Moses Lake Recordings&quot;</i></b></a><br>
CD (Gear Fab) Long-overdue release of the Bards&#8217; 1968 sessions,<br>
showing the Northwest group anxious to explore sophisticated concepts<br>
and the newest studio tricks; producers Curt Boetcher and Keith<br>
Olsen were happy to oblige. Highlights include a chanting Beefheartesque<br>
adaptation of Dr. Seuss&#8217; <i>Bartholomew and the Oobleck,</i> and<br>
the ambitious seven-part biblical &quot;The Creation.&quot; Scattered<br>
around are some bubbly pop songs that seem light years behind<br>
the weirder material, suggesting mind expansion midway through<br>
the writing process. An odd, and most interesting, discovery.</p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QK45/bubblegumbook">Beachwood Sparks <i>Once We Were Trees</i></a> CD (Sub Pop) Take the most<br>
shimmering, atmospheric sounds of the Beatles and Galaxie 500,<br>
add a little Burritos and Stones, then imagine Tiny Tim fronting<br>
the Jacobites covering &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;-well,<br>
maybe not that insanely good, but they sure try. If they manage<br>
to stay humble in the wake of that MTV video, we might have something<br>
here. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000059XT6/bubblegumbook"><b>Black Sun Ensemble <i>S/T</i></b></a><b><i> </i></b>CD (Camera Obscura)<br>
Slightly altered 2001 reissue of the DIY psych masters&#8217; supremely<br>
scarce self-released debut, moody guitar mystics unfolding like<br>
dreams snatched on waking. Hypnotic, cyclical stuff that, while<br>
recorded in the Arizona desert, feels just as strongly of the<br>
Sahara, or the Gobi, or the bottom of the sea. Byron Coley&#8217;s notes<br>
help explain the strange paths that the music took to end up here.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Y4A7/bubblegumbook"><b>Black Sun Ensemble <i>Hymn of the Master</i></b></a><b><i> </i></b>CD<br>
(Camera Obscura) Encouraged by positive response to the Camera<br>
Obscura reissue campaign, troubled BSE leader Jesus Acedo has<br>
put together a new version of the band. If you&#8217;re looking for<br>
esoteric instro guitar ruminations, be warned that this disk kicks<br>
off with a skronky thing with Jesus <i>singing</i> about what<br>
a <i>funky monkey</i> he is. Quit snorting: if you go to the hospital<br>
and get out again, you can make whatever sort of music you like.<br>
There are instrumentals, but they too mostly come from a more<br>
carnal zone. The last three tracks are more typically meditative.<br>
It&#8217;s all a bit much for me, but with plenty of wild guitar in<br>
play, fans will want to hear what he&#8217;s up to.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000063X01/bubblegumbook"><b>The Black Widows <i>Arocknaphobia </i></b></a>CD (Vital Gesture) All<br>
right, these guys claim that their brand of surf type instrumentals<br>
isn&#8217;t surf at all, but <i>spider rock</i>. Whatever you say boys.<br>
I mean spiderboys. Pretty good for music made by insects. You&#8217;d<br>
think bugs were just into noise and experimental buzzes, but occasionally<br>
you do get some members of the animal kingdom that can rock like<br>
people. Dark, reverberant garage rock, only occasionally sounding<br>
sissified like it was created by college students. While each<br>
piece does stand on it&#8217;s own, they would be rounded out nicely<br>
by some far out vocals, dig? (Margaret Griffis)</p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000631QC/bubblegumbook">David Blue <i>S/T</i></a><i> </i>CD (Collector&#8217;s Choice) It&#8217;s easy to<br>
call David Blue on his Dylan fixation, never more blatant than<br>
on this 1966 Elektra album recorded with several of Bob&#8217;s sidemen.<br>
But the pastiche is stylish and brimming with enthusiasm, a fake<br>
that&#8217;s in some ways more likeable than the real, ice-cool thing.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068FTY/bubblegumbook"><b>Curt Boetcher <i>There&#8217;s An Innocent Face</i></b></a> CD (Sundazed)<br>
After the Millennium split up, Boettcher (he dropped the &quot;t&quot;<br>
on this album on a numerologist&#8217;s advice) didn&#8217;t know what to<br>
do with himself. Inspired by what Emitt Rhodes had accomplished<br>
alone with overdubs, he paired up with multi-instrumentalist Web<br>
Burrell and spent two years honing this odd album for Elektra.<br>
It&#8217;s a fascinating, intermittently successful mish-mash of pomp,<br>
pop and old timey country, with several stunning love songs sitting<br>
uneasily alongside weird rock star parody &quot;Bobby California&quot;<br>
and the tune about a guitar-playing frog.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000065AOQ/bubblegumbook"><b>Boss Martians</b> <i>Making the Rounds</i></a><br>
CD (Musick) Another tuff and tuneful outing from the Martians,<br>
who&#8217;ve forged a tasteful garage soul sound distinguished by strong<br>
songs and Evan Foster&#8217;s assured, emotive singing. &quot;Dreaming<br>
in Stereo&quot; shows them working a surprising power pop vein.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FSR0/bubblegumbook"><b>Brando</b><br>
<i>Single Crown Postcard</i></a> CD (Recordhead &amp; Mr. Whiggs)<br>
Emerging from long hibernation in an Indiana basement, Brando<br>
is Derek Richey and a rotating cast of fellow travelers. They<br>
make subtle, meandering, thoughtful and layered dream tunes, with<br>
occasional, effective high-energy flashes.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000063VED/bubblegumbook"><b>The Briefs</b> </a>&quot;Poor and Weird&quot; + 2 CD EP (Interscope)<br>
Monochromatic fake &#8217;79 punk that might not sound out of place<br>
on a late KBD comp and what wonderful art direction!</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000062YAP/bubblegumbook"><b>Brother JT3</b> <i>Spirituals</i></a> CD (Drag<br>
City) One of two new disks from the prolific and ever intriguing<br>
Original Sins leader, offering up a fresh twist on holy rolling<br>
that&#8217;s warm, appealing and maybe kinda carnal. Definitely this<br>
summer&#8217;s make out record of choice for Jesus freaks and the people<br>
who love them.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005YXPG/bubblegumbook"><b>Brother JT</b> <i>Maybe We Should Take Some More?</i></a> CD (Birdman)<br>
You read that title right: this is John Terlesky&#8217;s dope record,<br>
partly a meandering soup of muttered suggestions, conversational<br>
loops, buzzing unidentifiable instruments and frog croaks. It&#8217;s<br>
also got sweet folkish melodies made sweeter for living in such<br>
a freaky neighborhood.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OL6S/bubblegumbook"><b>Bertrand Burgalat</b> <i>Meets A.S Dragon</i><br>
</a>CD (Tricatel) Bertrand Burgalat, the French Phil-Spector-meets-Kraftwerk<br>
producer-cult-singer, decided to go on a live frenzy. Bertrand&#8217;s<br>
backing band A.S Dragon knows how to shake hidden parts of your<br>
brain. It&#8217;s interesting to see such a mild mannered man, adept<br>
at churning out sophisticated pop albums, going amok. Bertrand<br>
and A.S Dragon revisit their own repertoires as well as those<br>
of April March, Smokey Robinson and Amanda Lear, to mesmerizing<br>
effects. A nostalgia-free but still vintagey trip that Olivia<br>
Newton-John and her alien friends circa Toomorrow would have raved<br>
about. It&#8217;s the perfect mix of raw rock electronic dissonance<br>
and pristine mint harmony. File under Death-Bubblegum disco. (Jean-Emmanuel<br>
Dubois)</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005Y4PB/bubblegumbook"><b>Caitlin Cary</b> <i>While You Weren&#8217;t Looking</i><br>
</a>CD (Yep Roc) This Chris Stamey-produced solo debut from gal<br>
who played fiddle and harmony behind Ryan Adams in Whiskeytown,<br>
is closer to early &#8217;70s UK folk rock than to her old band&#8217;s off-kilter<br>
C&amp;W. A nice sound, though emotionally falling somewhat flat.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Centimeters</b> &quot;Help is on the Way&quot; b/w &quot;African<br>
Paper &quot; 45 (Space Baby) Unusually pretty and subdued outing<br>
from the bizarro world (via Los Angeles) cabaret stars, with the<br>
a-side drifting dreamily off into Ed Wood soundtrack territory.</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068FTX/bubblegumbook"><b>Chad and Jeremy <i>Before and After</i></b></a> CD (Sundazed) The duo&#8217;s<br>
1965 Columbia debut, recorded in a week with Lor Crane and a coterie<br>
of elderly session cats. Considering the rush, the record turned<br>
out well, and shows the pair honing their signature style amidst<br>
a little experimenting. Gentle whispery C&amp;J ballads share<br>
space with rockers, and lovely trad folk like &quot;Fare Thee<br>
Well.&quot; Bonus cuts include alternate takes, the one-off Chad<br>
&amp; Jill 45 and Italian-language songs performed at the San<br>
Remo Festival</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="/web/20120305151828/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068FTV/bubblegumbook"><b>Chad Stuart and Jeremy Clyde</b> <i>Of Cabbages and Kings</i></a> CD<br>
(Sundazed) Recipe for a masterpiece: take two cuddly British invaders<br>
(hitherto known as Chad and Jeremy), add one psychedelic superproducer<br>
(Gary Usher), the full resources of Columbia Records, and a pinch<br>
of Curt Boettcher harmonies. Let rise in a dark place with a pinch<br>
of the British class struggle, world hunger, sexual freedom, the<br>
American death industry, and two heaping dollops of mescaline.<br>
The result: a fascinating, funny, sad and beautiful record that<br>
has long been #1 on my list of things I hoped would see reissue.<br>
Sundazed includes their usual bounty of unreleased tracks and<br>
45s, and terrific Jud Cost notes. Essential.</p>

Imagine the strange result of a mad scientist&#8217;s experiment using<br>
early Beck cells and quirky n&eacute;o-y&eacute;y&eacute; Frenchness.<br>
Dream no more, here it is. It&#8217;s a shame that Michel Gondry (director<br>
of Bjork&#8217;s &quot;Human Behavior&quot; video) is the only member<br>
of Etienne&#8217;s band Oui-Oui to have achieved worldwide hipster credibility.<br>
Kindercore, home of the Elephant 6 posse, recognized a kindred<br>
spirit, even if he was an ocean and countless idioms away, and<br>
they decided to co-release this album. Etienne Charry uses collages<br>
and &quot;naivet&eacute;&quot; in an unpretentious arty-free way,<br>
like western pop recreated by the Banana Splits high on Gallic<br>
spacecake. (Jean-Emmanuel Dubois)</p>

<p><b>The Cherokees</b> <i>The GO!! Sessions </i>LP (Corduroy)<br>
A sampling of the Melbourne beat band&#8217;s mid-&#8217;60s recordings for<br>
the GO!! label. Distinguished by strong vocals, good taste in<br>
covers (Hollies, Beau Brummels) and lotsa energy, this comp is<br>
a swell addition to any Aussie rock collection. Also available<br>
as a Canetoad CD.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jonathan Coe, Louis Philippe &amp; Danny Manners</b> <i>9th<br>
&amp; 13th</i> CD (Tricatel) Highly original blend of suave jazzbo<br>
riffing and sardonically romantic storytelling, some stories spoken,<br>
others sung. I didn&#8217;t realize on first listen that the words come<br>
out of Coe&#8217;s existing books and aren&#8217;t meant to hang together<br>
as a narrative. An interesting and quite successful experiment.</p>

</i>double CD (Corduroy) Catching up with the Melbourne trio some<br>
years after digging &quot;Lost Cause,&quot; I find that they&#8217;ve<br>
always known how to Keep It Simple, Stupid, and maintain a good<br>
inspiration/ perspiration ratio in their deliciously crass three-chord<br>

<p><b>Crimson Sweet</b> &quot;So Electric&quot; b/w &quot;No Hot<br>
On Cold&quot; 45 (Slow Gold Zebra) Raw postpunk from an NYC trio,<br>

CD (Sundazed) The Chicago band&#8217;s 1966 Columbia debut shows them<br>
drawing on a blend of US and British beat influences, with the<br>
Byrdsy outings most successful. Arrangements and harmonies on<br>
the rushed recordings can be ragged, but the Shames slide through<br>
on passion. Bonus tracks feature several originals by transitional<br>
member Lenny Kerley, whose sophisticated writing would make the<br>
next album such a psych-pop blast. Liner notes explain how handless<br>
tambourine player Jim Pilster&#8217;s barbed hook won them press attention-and<br>
on-stage injuries.</p>

With album #2 the Shames distinguished themselves as one of the<br>
finest American baroque pop acts. Unforgettable melodies, ambitious<br>
arrangements, and a unusual blend of moodiness and punk energy<br>
make side one of <i>Scratch</i> essential listening, though the<br>
quality of the material trails off somewhat on the flip. With<br>
the addition of 45 mixes and a McKuen inspired b-side, this Sundazed<br>
package is a fine replacement for treasured vinyl.</p>

CD (Sundazed) And here&#8217;s where it all fell apart, into a stylistic<br>
stew that never stops bubbling long enough to allow a proper taste.<br>
Opener &quot;Greenburg, Glickstein, Charles, David Smith &amp;<br>
Jones&quot; is a punky groover, but with the next track they&#8217;re<br>
mourning a Hoagy Carmichael heroine, and later don Buffalo Springfield<br>
masks. While there are some good songs and performances, the variety<br>
is just too extreme to make a cohesive whole.</p>

<p><b>Curlupanddie</b> <i>Unfortunately We&#8217;re Not Robots</i> CD<br>
(Revelation) Thrashmetal the way momma likes it. Brutal. Grinding.<br>
Menacing. These guys from Vegas have been damaged not only by<br>
the sun and heat, but by SST, AmRep and a host of hardcore bands<br>
too. First point of order is the song titles. These have got to<br>
be the best I&#8217;ve seen in years. &quot;Ted Nugent goes AOL&quot;<br>
and &quot;Doctor Doom, A Man of Science, Doesn&#8217;t Believe in Jesus,<br>
Why The Fuck Do You&quot; make my cold heart warm like molten<br>
steel. The first four titles you have to see for yourself. I can&#8217;t<br>
do them proper justice here. If that isn&#8217;t enough of a sale for<br>
you, the music&#8217;s good. There&#8217;s stuff here that will curl the tail<br>
of any deathmetalhead, but there are also arty moments that are<br>
disjointed enough for the average Sonic Youth fan. The vocals<br>
are gurgling sounds of a possum caught in an engine. The only<br>
complaints I have are the possum vocals should be louder in the<br>
mix, and I want more songs on the CD so my ears can start bleeding<br>
properly. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p><b>Dan &amp; Kev and the Deadset Friendlies</b> &quot;Don&#8217;t<br>
Change&quot; / &quot;Elvis&quot; CD EP (Corduroy) Upbeat and sincere<br>
punky folk from a couple of lads who sound like they&#8217;d be at home<br>
in front of a pint or with noses in books. &quot;Elvis&quot; is<br>
a story-song about a guy whose friends encourage to act the star,<br>

arch disk from teeny chambermaid Angie Tillett &amp; co. treats<br>
sixties pop culture like fudge ingredients, boiling wah-wah pedals,<br>
Bentley cars, Bridget Riley&#8217;s op art paintings, and <i>The Avengers</i><br>
down into a thick syrup further flavored with vibes, dreamy bossa<br>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Decembrists</b> <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i> CD (Hush)<br>
If the long silence of Neutral Milk Hotel chafes at you, try rubbing<br>
these marvelous Portlanders on the sore spot. I am charmed by<br>

self-reflexive legionnaires, bedwetters and assorted oddballs.<br>

<p><b>Jean-Emmanuel Deluxe and Alexander Faem</b> <i>Tribute to Alain Delon and Jean-Pierre Melville</i> CD (Euro-Visions) This<br>
disk is an aural kiss for legendary director Jean-Pierre Melville<br>
and equally legendary actor Alain Delon. Deluxe and Faem star<br>
as the ringmasters while Saint Etienne, Merricks, X-Ray Pop, Mansour,<br>
Monochrome Kid, and Frederik Schikowski play the remixers. Co-conspirators<br>
include a handful of disparate, subterranean talent. Luis Rego<br>
prepares us for the experience to follow with a monologue of tweaked<br>
inflection. April March&#8217;s voice is sweet like a chorus of tiny<br>
bells, contrasting with and complementing Deluxe&#8217;s endearingly<br>
off-kilter vocals. Deluxe&#8217;s inability to sing is his charm. He<br>
is a poet evoking rather than a crooner crooning, and &quot;Paris<br>
Lisbonne&quot; is a gem, pop poetry running after Delon through<br>
gangster-ridden streets and psychedelic sequences in the Metro.<br>
For kinetic stimulation, Bertrand Burgalat&#8217;s vibes and keyboards<br>
are splattered throughout. Jacno strums guitar for one of the<br>
disc&#8217;s highlights, &quot;Loneliness is a Warm Gun,&quot; by far<br>
the sultriest piece as sung by Helena Noguerra. She is sonic striptease,<br>
and the grooves are deftly manipulated in two shploink remixes.<br>
Ariel Wizman chimes in occasionally, in bilingual &#8217;70s flares.<br>
References, both lyrical and instrumental, to various Melville<br>
and Delon scenarios take the music beyond simple pop hooks to<br>
a fantasy level, and there is a short salute to Christophe as<br>
well. Unfamiliar with Melville and Delon? It won&#8217;t hinder you<br>
from swinging to the sounds, but if you haven&#8217;t seen <i>Le Samourai</i>&#8230;.<br>

<p><b>The Gene Drayton Unit </b>&quot;Ordinary Twist &quot; +2<br>
45 (Butterfly) From the land where obscure American R&amp;B singles<br>
sell for more than our car payments comes this modern take on<br>
Hammond dance floor soul, a swinging original instro with bluesy<br>

Down at the<i> biergarten</i>, these lads are shaking the rafters<br>

Bluegrass and Write-a-song-so-lovely-you&#8217;ll-stop-breathing Steve.<br>

Pretty faithful to the Fastbacks type of &uuml;ber-poppy punkity<br>
rock. And since they live in LA, this probably means that while<br>
the Fastbacks have been condemned to near obscurity, the Excessories<br>
will end up on a lot of soundtracks thanks to some A&amp;R guy<br>
who&#8217;s never heard punk rock in any of its original incarnations,<br>
but thinks the singer is cute and sweet on him. The music is very<br>
poppy, happy and danceable if you like to pogo. Pure bubblegum,<br>
well executed and exceedingly irritating if you happen to hate<br>
grown up women who sing like precocious little girls. I can&#8217;t<br>
imagine anyone with a wisp of testosterone singing along with<br>
this. Honest fellas, it won&#8217;t get you laid, except by control<br>
hags who sense your weakness. Amusingly, the singer is also the<br>
lead songwriter and sends everyone else&#8217;s songs to the last tracks<br>

<p><b>Foundation X</b> <i>American Folk Horror</i> CD (Estrus)<br>
Grungy dark hard rock with a good sprinkling of the old southern<br>

LP by a band you&#8217;d never guess was from Greenwich Village-though<br>

Peter Sando only got two songs on the album, but they can hold<br>
their little heads up beside &quot;Hang On To A Dream&quot; and<br>

<p><b>Giant</b> &quot;Wishing Bone &quot; + 2 CD EP (Twist) Cocky,<br>
old school bombast &amp; jangle, with bass solos, falsetto hooks<br>

<p><b>Richard Hell</b> <i>Time</i> double CD (Matador) Disk one<br>
is the old Roir cassette collection <i>RIP</i> (Heartbreakers,<br>
three incarnations of the Voidoids, Hell in New Orleans) with<br>
a few worthy bonus cuts, disk two the live and dangerous-sounding<br>
Quine Voidoids in NY and London circa 1977-78. Hell&#8217;s tricky,<br>
one minute brilliant, the next exasperating. When he was focused<br>
there wasn&#8217;t another American punk who could come close to his<br>
iconic precision, of which the rough, bug-eyed beauty was merely<br>
the most obvious sign. He was a &quot;real&quot; poet, and seemingly<br>
simple pop songs about girls and dope often conceal existential<br>
cul de sacs and sneaky linguistic bowshots. The Voidoids crafted<br>
a wonderful spiky castle of noise for this wicked little princeling<br>
to prowl, though the bleating vocals and stuttering rhythms make<br>
it an acquired taste. Don&#8217;t miss: the startlingly soulful &quot;Cruel<br>
Way to Go Down,&quot; or the casual evil of &quot;Hurt Me,&quot;<br>
which ought to be assigned for discussion in high schools instead<br>
of that tedious Hannah Arendt book.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Hellacopters</b> <i>High Visibility </i>CD (Gearhead)<br>
The line between Detroit-style hard rock and irony-free heavy<br>

<p><b>Iggy &amp; the Stooges</b> <i>Wild Love: The Detroit Rehearsals<br>

Shaw had a giant chicken heart cross-bred with Stooge cells growing<br>
in a nutrient-rich bath deep in the bowels of Bomp Manor, from<br>
which he occasionally took scrapings for public issue. But Greg&#8217;s<br>
no mad scientist, just a magnet for rarities, and Iggy freaks<br>
should rejoice at this annotated set of unreleased originals,<br>
covers and best-of excerpts from endless jams. Apparently dating<br>
from the <i>Raw Power</i> through <i>Kill City</i> eras, these<br>
are the loose and dirty shards that inform the finished works,<br>
and weird sidetrips, like Iggy, James Williamson and a drum machine<br>
taking on Dylan&#8217;s &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Impossible Shapes</b> <i>Laughter Fills Our Hollow Dome</i><br>

friendly monster that&#8217;s about to soak you with its tongue.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Insta</b> <i>Horn Rim Fury</i> CD EP (Sunday) Insta is mainly<br>
Adam and Catherine Cooper, formerly the Pastry Heroes. Their homegrown<br>
whispery Cardigans-esque pop sound is lush and adept, though no<br>
one song particularly stands out on this EP.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Garland Jeffreys</b> <i>Wild in the Streets (Best of 1977-1983)<br>
</i>CD (Raven) It&#8217;s long since time I gave this critic&#8217;s darling<br>
a spin, because he&#8217;s <i>really</i> good. Jeffreys&#8217; quintessentially<br>
New York songs blend reggae, pop, jazz and Latin ingredients into<br>
a persona that&#8217;s streetwise yet romantic, and never clich&eacute;d.<br>
And the vocals are just gorgeous. This chronological comp features<br>
most of the <i>Ghost Writer</i> album, then touches on everything<br>
through <i>Guts for Love</i>, and has really piqued my interest.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b><i>Just Farr a Laugh: The Greatest Prank Phone Calls Ever</i></b><i><br>
</i>CD (Failed Pilot) The subtitle on this post-caller ID era<br>
artifact is excessively boastful, but who wants to listen to humble<br>
pranksters? The best prank calls are those where the recipient<br>
is fully engaged in the conversation and urges the caller to ever<br>
greater heights of strangeness. Track 19, which gives this collection<br>
its title, is a delightfully wide-ranging conversation about yogurt<br>
machines, small business and inspirational literature that didn&#8217;t<br>
hurt anyone&#8217;s feelings. Other highlights are the exceptional customer<br>
service offered by a supermarket manager when &quot;Isaac Hayes&quot;<br>
calls to complain about being harassed in the parking lot, and<br>
several calls starring Bleachy, a roly poly pleasure seeker who<br>
only wants a chance to serve his country. Good clean fun, with<br>
self-reflexive liner notes.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Kaisers</b> <i>Shake Me!</i> CD (Get Hip) You can count<br>
on Scotland&#8217;s Kaisers for time machine-perfect British Invasion<br>
pop, made more impressive by the fact that the lads write all<br>
their songs themselves. The Searchers didn&#8217;t do that! If your<br>
tastes run to twangy guitars, lovelorn harmonies and clean cut<br>
kicks, the Kaisers are your cuppa tea.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Lackloves</b> <i>star city baby</i> CD (Rainbow Quartz)<br>
Shimmery early sixties-style pop from Milwaukee, with handclaps,<br>
hooks and harmony to spare.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Ted Leo/ Pharmacists</b> <i>The Tyranny of Distance</i><br>
CD (Lookout) Martial jangle pop with a splash of Thin Lizzy spunk,<br>
eclectic, sweetly sung (lotsa falsetto), and surprisingly on Lookout.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Loud Family</b> <i>From Ritual to Romance </i>CD (125)<br>
If Scott Miller had a share of Pepsi stock for every time some<br>
ink-stained wretch called him a genius, he&#8217;d still probably be<br>
bitter and more prone to threats of retirement than any three<br>
dinosaur bands combined. Just because you write the smartest pop<br>
lyrics of your generation, and have a master angler&#8217;s facility<br>
with hooks, and a few thousand people love what you do, that doesn&#8217;t<br>
mean <i>anything</i>. Scott learned that in the nineties, and<br>
left the gentle fields of Game Theory for pricklier experiments<br>
as the Loud Family. These tapes, recorded on the band&#8217;s 1996 and<br>
1998 tours, reveal the rough, antagonistic power of the late Louds,<br>
their willingness to take Scott&#8217;s songs in their teeth and shake<br>
&#8217;em silly, all of which made the fundamental prettiness of the<br>
music seem more touching and fragile. With Eno, Pixies and My<br>
Bloody Valentine covers, and a closing salvo that left me breathless<br>
and punching the replay button.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Helen Love</b> <i>Radio Hits 3</i> CD (Damaged Goods) Like<br>
a tasty pink wad of electro girlie bubblegum punk, wrapped up<br>
in self referential pomo Mobius Strip ribbons stolen off the Shangri-Las,<br>
laid on your doorstep with a note that says &quot;Eat me.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Love Generation</b> <i>Love and Sunshine: The Best of</i><br>
CD (Sundazed) On the covers of their three Imperial albums, the<br>
Love Generation looked about as hip as math tutors on a field<br>
trip, but no Calculus geek ever sung as sweetly as the B&auml;hler<br>
brothers. These were the voices that would be tapped to be the<br>
on-record Partridge Family a few years hence, and the treacly<br>
magic was already flowing. Their lush take on prime period themes<br>
like first love, grooviness, summertime sun and finding oneself<br>
is a must for sunshine pop freaks. Pick hit: the glorious &quot;Consciousness<br>
Expansion,&quot; where the singer apparently takes a trip into<br>
inner space just from the thrill of renting his first apartment!<br>
This disk compiles most of the deliriously breezy songs from the<br>
hard-to-find LPs.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Luna</b> <i>Romantica</i> CD (Jetset) Aptly titled collection<br>
of high-gloss guitar and Dean Wareham&#8217;s precise and yearning expressions.<br>
To be avoided if the &quot;noodles&quot;/ &quot;oodles and oodles&quot;<br>
rhyme scheme is offensive to you.</p>

<p><b>The Lust-O-Rama</b> <i>Pure Lust </i>CD (Corduroy) Posthumous<br>
release from lightly accented Nordic <i>Pebbles</i> popsters active<br>
through the early &#8217;90s, fittingly on an Australian label, since<br>
these cats would have fit just fine on a bill with the Psychotic<br>
Turnbuckles or Lime Spiders. Good screams from Arne Thelin, since<br>
gone on to the Kwyet Kings.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mach Pelican</b> &quot;Kim Salmon Sessions &quot; 45 (Corduroy)<br>
Charming, English language deficient pop fun. A-side &quot;Airport&quot;<br>
sounds like a sleepy Ramones in their wanna be your boyfriend<br>
mode. The flip&#8217;s a shaky take on producer Kim&#8217;s Scientists classic<br>
&quot;Last Night.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Martin &amp; Neil <i>Tear Down the Walls </i></b>CD (Collector&#8217;s<br>
Choice) Working with fellow Village folkie Vince Martin for this<br>
acoustic 1964 Elektra LP, Fred Neil&#8217;s darkness is lightened by<br>
Martin&#8217;s high, gentle tones. The title track is an optimistic<br>
protest number, and Martin does a talking blues about childhood,<br>
while handsome versions of &quot;Morning Dew,&quot; &quot;I Know<br>
You Rider&quot; and the original &quot;Wild Child in a World of<br>
Trouble&quot; teem with Neil&#8217;s signature moodiness. This is an<br>
interesting, transitional snapshot of the late folk-blues revival<br>
just before social consciousness, duos and cover songs yielded<br>
to individual voices.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jana McCall</b> <i>Slumber</i> CD (Up) The former Seattlite<br>
(she was in Dickless) has retreated to Montana, where she recorded<br>
this spooky, individualistic set. When paired with the Ruby Doe&#8217;s<br>
intense accompaniment, the clear, fluttering vocals and melancholic<br>
melodies impress.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mello Cads</b> <i>Soft as a Rock</i> CD (Franklin Castle)<br>
In the grand tradition espoused by early <i>Playboy</i> editorials<br>
and the Marquis de Sade, prime Cad David Ponak stakes out his<br>
masculine terrain in a song cycle taking his alter ego &quot;David&quot;<br>
across the emotional landscapes formed by lust and regret. Young<br>
cads sometimes think they need to express themselves through power<br>
chords and shrieking, but cads of a certain age recognize that<br>
channeling Jack Jones, Dick Hyman and Scott Walker is not only<br>
more expressive, but it also grabs the ladies. Paul Williams joins<br>
our troubled troubadour on the bonus version of &quot;The Drifter.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Richard Meltzer, Robert Pollard, Smegma, Antler &amp; Vom<br>
<i>The Completed Soundtrack for the Tropic of Nipples</i></b><br>
CD (Off) Okay, pay attention. Not only do you get the Vom &quot;Live<br>
at Surf City&quot; EP (deliriously retarded &#8217;78 punk from the<br>
wisest guys in Hollywood), but also recent declaiming by a bemused<br>
Meltzer accompanied by the soaring noise and looped lunacy of<br>
Smegma and GBV&#8217;s Robert Pollard playing a similar role with Antler.<br>
It&#8217;s the soundtrack to something or other. I think there&#8217;s some<br>
extra Vom material which I haven&#8217;t heard before, but the notes<br>
are cryptic. That&#8217;s all I can figure out, and I need to take a<br>
damp cloth to the stereo now.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Mooney Suzuki</b> <i>Electric Sweat</i> CD (Gammon)<br>
We already know what the Mooneys are good at: hard-rocking, stripped-down<br>
Detroitiana delivered with a knee-drop intensity unmatched since<br>
little Michael Jackson tried to shake himself out of his skin.<br>
Well, that and stinky stagewear. And that&#8217;s great, and we love<br>
them for it. But on their second full-length album the band is<br>
messing with the formula: to wit &quot;The Broken Heart,&quot;<br>
maybe the most stunning piece of original blues to come outta<br>
the garage rock revival <i>ever</i>. Jesus, boys, you already<br>
had our heads, loins and nostrils. Had to steal our hearts, too?</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mr. T Experience</b> <i>&#8230;And the Women Who Love Them</i><br>
CD (Lookout) Re-issue of the classic EP, but with enough sugary<br>
extras for even the most borderline diabetic to OD on. Re-mastered<br>
along with 19 other tracks that appeared on various collections,<br>
singles, demos and other dark and dank places, this CD-only release<br>
is pretty happening. Is it Poppy Punk or Punky Pop? I&#8217;ll take<br>
the latter, since most of the time this would sound more at home<br>
at the house party of some &quot;clever&quot; LA hipster than<br>
at Gilman St. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Mystaken</b> &quot;Don&#8217;t Fuck Wiv Me &quot; b/w &quot;Hey<br>
Little Girl &quot; 45 (Corduroy) &quot;Don&#8217;t Fuck&quot; features<br>
raw, angry vocals over a solid wall of thud, with bassist Maria&#8217;s<br>
sweet responses offsetting the ire in Sally&#8217;s lead. A neat sexual<br>
inversion of trad garage conventions, and surprisingly catchy.<br>
The flip&#8217;s a more diffuse expression of annoyance that makes me<br>
think they&#8217;re not such hard girls after all.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Fred Neil <i>Bleecker &amp; MacDougal </i></b>CD (Collector&#8217;s<br>
Choice) On his second record for Elektra (see Martin &amp; Neil<br>
above), accompanied by John Sebastian and Felix Pappalardi, Neil<br>
soars with all original material and astonishing, open-throated<br>
singing. Blue and hopeful, country and citified, he ties up all<br>
his contradictions so they don&#8217;t get in his way and stakes his<br>
claim as one of the best singers of the folk revival.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Paybacks</b> <i>Knock Loud</i> CD (Get Hip) Swaggering,<br>
heartfelt actual Detroit rock &amp; roll, spearheaded by Wendy<br>
Case&#8217;s raspy, androgynous vocals. Just right for drinking and<br>
driving, not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Pedestrians</b> <i>An Evening At &quot;Pearl&#8217;s&quot;<br>
Hurricane </i>CD (Bacchus Archives) Recorded live in 1979, this<br>
is supposedly Tucson&#8217;s very first punk show. Besides the band<br>
and audience, there can&#8217;t be too many people who will enjoy this,<br>
but at the same time it&#8217;s strangely intoxicating, and an accurate<br>
portrayal of your typical punk/ wave bar band of the period. Only<br>
five original songs littered among lots of &quot;cool&quot; covers:<br>
Rolling Stones, Ramones, both Elvises. This has seen the light<br>
of day because members including Chris Cacavas went on to play<br>
in Green On Red, Naked Prey or Giant Sand. It was originally released<br>
locally in Tucson last year, but those nutcases at Bacchus saw<br>
fit to bring it to the wider world. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Periscopes</b> &quot;Beaver Shot&quot; b/w Happy to<br>
Be&quot; 45 (Bacchus Archives) &quot;Beaver Shot&quot; revels<br>
in its more-than-implied lewdness, a dirty, messy frat rock instro<br>
peppered with off color exclamations. You need it for your jukebox.<br>
The flip is a &quot;Louie Louie&quot; rip off that sounds like<br>
it&#8217;s being sung in unison by four guys still in the bar at closing<br>
time. Totally retarded, in a good way.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Andr&eacute; Popp</b> <i>Popp Musique</i> CD (Tricatel)<br>
The common factor is producer Popp, the ringmaster behind these<br>
twenty giddy, sometimes erotique sixties pop confections. On &quot;L&#8217;Homme<br>
Invisible,&quot; the invisible man can be heard ravishing some<br>
unsuspecting cutie, possibly Francine Lain&eacute;, whose cooing<br>
vocals on &quot;Lolitissimo&quot; are deliciously overdone. Also<br>
features Astrid Gilberto and Claudine Longet, and even Herman&#8217;s<br>
Hermits get the Popp treatment with the music hall-esque &quot;Years<br>
May Come, Years May Go.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Patrick Porter <i>reverb saved my life </i></b>CD (Camera<br>
Obscura) These salvaged teenage solo recordings from &#8217;96-&#8217;97 are<br>
gentle, thoughtful lite-psych explorations wrapped around poetic<br>
lyrics that reward reading. The songs don&#8217;t really go anywhere,<br>
but the small area they occupy is enticing. &quot;Prodigy&quot;<br>
is a label that alienates everyone involved, so let&#8217;s just acknowledge<br>
that this is deep, sweet stuff that shows great promise. He&#8217;s<br>
writing books and playing in Phineas Gage now.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Pretty Girls Make Graves</b> <i>Good Health</i> CD (Lookout)<br>
Driving upbeat punk rock that was popular with the young &quot;new<br>
school&quot; punks a decade ago, but with vocals occasionally<br>
distilled from the X-Ray Spex/Vice Squad/Crass era of feminine<br>
wiles. Think Sonic Youth jamming with Fugazi at the Spoke house.<br>
They play their music like their life depended on it or at least<br>
in order to avoid day jobs (which is way more important than life<br>
itself). The first tune &quot;Speakers Push the Air&quot; is a<br>
classic &quot;hit single&quot; that in a just world should be<br>
getting airplay across the country. It&#8217;s absolutely perfect. This<br>
is their first full length, but features veterans of the Murder<br>
City Devils, Kill Sadie, the Beehive Vaults, and the Death Wish<br>
Kids. (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Chuck Prophet</b> <i>Homemade Blood </i>LP (Corduroy) Vinyl<br>
reish of the former Green on Red guy&#8217;s &#8217;97 release is full of<br>
loose and confidant rootsy rock and roll in the &quot;been there<br>
and lived to regret it&quot; vein.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Public Nuisance</b> <i>Gotta Survive</i> double CD (Frantic)<br>
To be a public nuisance, you gotta question everything-and then<br>
be self righteous about it, too, right? Well, every one of these<br>
28 refreshing songs recorded from 1966 to 1969 by four black-turtlenecked<br>
Sacramento boys who went from being called the Jaguars to Moss<br>
&amp; the Rocks to Public Nuisance, and finally to Glad, is filled<br>
with questions. Question yourself. Question me. Question what<br>
our bodily functions are doing. Question the Now and the Tomorrow.<br>
Question Charlie. But wait, don&#8217;t question &quot;love;&quot; question<br>
if you can love your brother and if we can love one another! Nothing<br>
overly preaching here, people. Just groovy heavy exclamations!<br>
Don&#8217;t question if some of these songs sound a bit like songs you<br>
already know by the Pretty Things or the Seeds. Question if a<br>
re-written imitation of Blue Cheer is the sincerest form of flattery.<br>
What if it sounds even better? Hell, <i>yes!</i> (Kelly Kuvo)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Joey Ramone</b> <i>Don&#8217;t Worry About Me</i> CD (Sanctuary)<br>
On Joey&#8217;s first and last solo project, he still delivers. Although<br>
some tunes are reminiscent of the mature ponderings of mid-&#8217;80s<br>
Ramones, every tune is delivered in Joey&#8217;s trademark bubbly yet<br>
no-B.S. style. Choice tracks include the wacked kid show stylings<br>
of &quot;Mr. Punchy,&quot; the Kinks-like &quot;Spirit In My House,&quot;<br>
and &quot;Like A Drug I Never Did Before,&quot; with Joey affecting<br>
a bit of a Sky Saxon drawl. Plus there are killer covers of the<br>
Stooges&#8217; &quot;1969&quot; and Louis Armstrong&#8217;s &quot;What A Wonderful<br>
World,&quot; a personal fave with its &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot;<br>
riff that gives way to Joey singing sweetly of things that make<br>
him enjoy being a boy in love with life. And &quot;I Got Knocked<br>
Down (But I&#8217;ll Get Up)&quot; is bouncier than a roomful of red<br>
rubber balls. With all the loving attentions of &#8217;90s Ramones producer<br>
Daniel Rey, and friends Andy Shernoff, Captain Sensible, Marky<br>
Ramone, and punkette Helen Love, <i>Don&#8217;t Worry About Me</i> is<br>
an ideal tribute to one of the great bubblerock heroes of all<br>
time. (Jillian Ford)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Tracey Read</b> <i>Everything is Real</i> CD (Chapter) Gentle,<br>
stripped-down songs that pulse with a quiet cynicism belied by<br>
Read&#8217;s sugary coo. For early mornings and aftermaths.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Reigning Sound</b> <i>Time Bomb High School</i> CD (In the<br>
Red) Slow, sweet, languid and desperate, with pumping retro keys,<br>
subtly witty lyrics and moments of near-hysterical realism. Sincerely<br>
swell rock and roll.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Resonars</b> <i>Lunar Kit</i> CD (Get Hip) All by his<br>
lonesome, Matt Rendon manages to make some pretty convincing late<br>
&#8217;60s psych, though the one-man band thing means he takes his time<br>
between albums. The new one spins off from <i>Bright and Dark</i>&#8216;s<br>
melancholia with a tougher, garage-punk edge. The constants remain<br>
Matt&#8217;s sweetly nasal voice, memorable hooks, and an admirable<br>
brevity. Why waste five minutes when you can get your point across<br>
in 2:35?</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Risk</b> <i>songs from the big tomato</i> CD (Twist)<br>
Twist mainman Mark Le Gallez&#8217; own band is a strutting modish confection<br>
very much in the label&#8217;s vein, Carnaby Street soul boys with hearts<br>
sewn to sleeves.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>RockFour</b> <i>Another Beginning</i> CD (Rainbow Quartz)<br>
Israeli pop-psych combo (singing in English) working a rich vein<br>
of lush, cascading guitar lines and soaring harmonies. Good songs,<br>
sweet sound.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Sadies</b> &quot;Cork &amp; Monkey&quot; + 2 45 CD (Mint)<br>
Jazzy western twang and late night regrets and ruminations, applying<br>
country conventions to a taste for punk and noise to produce something<br>
fresh. Kid Congo guests on one track.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Safe Home</b> <i>You Can&#8217;t Undo What&#8217;s Already Undid</i><br>
CD (Sunday) Dutch duo, with Esther Sprikkelman&#8217;s round tones mostly<br>
applied to English words. Their gentle sound incorporates organic<br>
and electronic elements with quiet, effective results.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Erik Sanko</b> <i>Past Imperfect, Present Tense</i> CD (Jetset)<br>
The solo debut from longtime Lounge Lizards bassist has a wonderfully<br>
spooky, meandering cartoonishness. Sanko&#8217;s weak, whispery voice<br>
carries the haunted house pop that teems with twang and mysterious<br>
burbles.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Peter Schirmann</b> <i>Fluchtweg St. Pauli OST</i> CD (Crippled<br>
Dick Hot Wax) Swinging, nasty crime jazz soundtrack to a 1971<br>
German hooker flick. Sounds range from big, brassy grooves to<br>
batty exotica, big band disco fuzz to a languid harpsichord bossa<br>
nova. Bonus tracks include remixes and Shirmann&#8217;s theme from <i>Bleib<br>
sauber Liebling,</i> with its ridiculous whining faux-Chinese<br>
vocals.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Raymond Scott Orchestrette</b> <i>Pushbutton Parfait</i><br>
CD (Evolver) Loose yet respectful interpretations of the cartoon<br>
soundtrack master&#8217;s batty work by a seven-piece combo that plays<br>
down the silliness to find and follow strains of classicism, Orientalism,<br>
dada and spy jazz in the repertoire.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Shakes</b> <i>S/T</i> CD (Teenacide) Jim Freek kicks<br>
off his new label with the long-anticipated debut by the ace Los<br>
Angeles popsters who can&#8217;t seem to hold onto a drummer. Pete Gilabert&#8217;s<br>
songs are crunchy and cranky, Janet Housden the perfect foil on<br>
bass and nyaa nyaa harmonies. And don&#8217;t miss the secret bonus<br>
track, their brilliant arrangement of Britney&#8217;s &quot;Oops, I<br>
Did It Again&quot; (shh, don&#8217;t tell Zomba).</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Shutdown 66</b> &quot;Stateside Shutdown&quot; 45 (Corduroy)<br>
The harp never stops wailing on these two slabs of garagey goodness,<br>
enhanced by fine grunts and yelps on the demo version of &quot;Sure<br>
Does Make Me Blue.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Sires</b> &quot;Beneath Me&quot; b/w &quot;Packing My<br>
Bags&quot; 45 (Corduroy) Contemporary London band working the<br>
time-honored tradition of girl-hating three-chord freakbeat. The<br>
high-pitched vocals on the flip sound like Fred Cole&#8217;s mom!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Slackjaw</b> <i>Darkest Hour</i> CD (No Karma) This impassioned<br>
Portland three-piece reminds me a lot of early U2, edgy, emotional,<br>
and jangling idealism all over the place.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Songs: Ohia</b> <i>Didn&#8217;t It Rain</i> CD (Secretly Canadian)<br>
The harmonies on this latest release by the collaboratory body<br>
that is Songs: Ohia do something to alleviate the desperately<br>
lonely sound of Jason Molina&#8217;s voice, but not so much that it<br>
loses its power. Simple, emotive melodies twine around that brave<br>
instrument, and while the emotional palette is fairly narrow,<br>
the effects are impressive.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>sparkle*jets u.k.</b> <i>Bamboo Lounge</i> CD (Crab Apple)<br>
The hardest working act in SoCal pop turns in a breezy set of<br>
harmony-drenched should-be summer radio hits, with the unexpected<br>
jolt of Susan West&#8217;s outer space bad girl vocals to keep your<br>
ears on their tippytoes. CD-ROM goodies on this classy slab include<br>
an entire burn-your-own live bootleg.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Speedball Baby</b> <i>The Blackout</i> CD (In the Red) Weirdo<br>
slow blues shot through with smutty free-association, chicken-killing<br>
shrieks, layers of chunky texture and a warm, organic flow that<br>
keeps things taut and interesting.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Spoils</b> <i>Hurtsville </i>CD (Corduroy) Seems the<br>
alt-country bug has been biting Australians, too. These laconic,<br>
lap steel-drenched ruminations on love, loss and being a louse<br>
have a kinda Stonesy swagger that I dig.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Stereophonic Space Sound Unlimited</b> <i>Jet Sound Inc.<br>
</i>CD (Dionysus) Releasing this set of witty spy-jazz-gone-surfin&#8217;<br>
originals seems a gutsy act in the post-post-lounge era. The perfect<br>
backdrop for that unironic tiki party.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Stratford 4</b> <i>The Revolt Against Tired Noises</i><br>
CD (Jetset) There&#8217;s plenty of invention and variety on this brainy<br>
pop disk (from SF, not Blighty), which veers from soft and fuzzy<br>
romanticism to edgy Richmanesque yearning, often with a secondary<br>
set of sounds distinct from the main melody, suggesting an emotional<br>
language running on a parallel track.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Nikki Sudden &amp; Dave Kusworth</b> <i>Jacobites</i> CD<br>
and <i>Robespierre&#8217;s Velvet Basement</i> double CD (Secretly Canadian)<br>
The Jacobites could have been the most contrived band to come<br>
out of England since (fill in the blank), but somehow their velvet<br>
jacket pretensions combined to make something magical. It certainly<br>
didn&#8217;t hurt that Nikki and Dave each had a marvelous way with<br>
melody, imbuing their simple tales of debased nobles and impossible<br>
girls with an epochal, timeless quality. These first two Jacobites<br>
records-Secretly Canadian will be reissuing all of Nikki&#8217;s &#8217;80s<br>
output-recall a time when poets were drunken reprobates who had<br>
to roll in the gutter to come up with something beautiful, something<br>
that was all the more striking for the foul milieu in which it<br>
emerged. No, not the sixties, at least not the <i>nineteen</i><br>
sixties. Good-bad, but not evil, the Jacobites troll the dark<br>
streets of the psyche in search of gems like &quot;Hearts are<br>
Like Flowers&quot;-where the boys recognize that &quot;you&#8217;ll<br>
do things in your life that&#8217;ll change someone more than you&#8217;ll<br>
ever change yourself&quot;-caught on tape for the ages. If you<br>
missed these scarf-draped troubadours first time around, don&#8217;t<br>
miss them now. Old fans will find plenty of bonus tracks, and<br>
Nikki&#8217;s somewhat revealing liner notes.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Thanes</b> <i>One night as I wandered on the Moors The<br>
best of </i>double LP (Corduroy) The Thanes have been plying their<br>
trade since 1986 in the semi-obscurity befitting an Edinburgh<br>
act that never moved to London. When I finally got to see them<br>
at the second Las Vegas Grind they knocked me out, so it&#8217;s neat<br>
to have so much of their history in one place. Here are 27 fine<br>
selections demonstrating that ebullient or moody, fuzzy or precise,<br>
Lenny Helsing&#8217;s band can always be counted on to take the basic<br>
garage conventions and turn them into something personal and exciting.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Kevin Tihista&#8217;s Red Terror</b> <i>Judo</i> CD (Parasol)<br>
Despite several attempts (hey, I&#8217;m usually a sucker for this kinda<br>
stuff), I couldn&#8217;t get anywhere with K.T.&#8217;s debut, <i>Don&#8217;t Breathe<br>
a Word.</i> But this time out I had more fun with the baroque,<br>
orchestral arrangements, whispery vocals and loopy tunes. I still<br>
don&#8217;t quite get it, but am keeping it around for future reference.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Tren Brothers &amp; Sister</b> &quot;Swing Pts. 1 &amp;<br>
2&quot; 45 (Chapter) Ghostly instrumental act conjuring up a thick,<br>
dark mood with scuttering drums, sighing violin and precise guitar<br>
(by Mick Turner), repeatedly building to subdued explosions and<br>
back again.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Townes Van Zandt</b> <i>A Gentle Evening With</i> CD (Dualtone)<br>
Townes, then 25, played Carnegie Hall in 1969, and the tape got<br>
lost in the vaults. Unearthed, it proves a brief yet striking<br>
look at the bard&#8217;s earliest live approach, already mingling heartbreakingly<br>
gorgeous songs (&quot;Rake,&quot; &quot;Tecumseh Valley&quot;)<br>
with rambling jokes and (possibly ad libbed) talking blues numbers.<br>
The only original that&#8217;ll be new to fans is &quot;Talking KKK<br>
Blues,&quot; but with fine performances and slightly altered picking<br>
from the recordings, the old stuff is well worth hearing.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> <i>Born out of Time: The Australian Indie Sound<br>
1979-88</i> CD (Raven) One of two interesting Radio Birdman-axis<br>
Aussie comps to land in my PO Box in the same week (see <i>Do<br>
The Pop</i> below), the Raven set mostly offers influential 45s<br>
from the Citadel, Waterfront and Au-Go-Go labels, with some inevitable<br>
overlap. Either collection is a good introduction to a vibrant<br>
scene, and you need this one to get Angie Pepper&#8217;s luminous &quot;Frozen<br>
World.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> <i>Can&#8217;t Stop It!: Australian Post-Punk 1978-82<br>
</i>CD (Chapter) Australia&#8217;s big enough for sounds bred elsewhere<br>
than Detroit, hence this interesting comp full of arty synth lines,<br>
cryptic symbolism, bleating vocalists and other signs of the neo-futurist<br>
times. Put together by folks who were there, <i>Can&#8217;t Stop It!</i><br>
blends scarce singles and unreleased and live recordings, including<br>
&quot;Help&quot; by the Apartments (refuge of banished Go-Between<br>
Peter Milton Walsh), and selections from Slugfuckers, Primitive<br>
Calculators, Ron Rude and People With Chairs Up Their Noses.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> <i>Deep Note: Music of 1970&#8217;s Adult Cinema</i> CD<br>
(O.S.T. Grammofonpladen) Entertaining sampler of raunchy jazz,<br>
analog synth noodling, sound effect-drenched pop and spoken word<br>
interludes distinguished by their relentlessly enthused amateurism.<br>
Films sourced include <i>Orgasmatron 75, Diary of a Horny Housewife</i>,<br>
and <i>The X-orcist.</i></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> <i>Do the Pop! The Australian Garage-Rock Sound<br>
1976-87</i> double CD (Shock) If you weren&#8217;t haunting the import<br>
bins for Rob Younger-produced Citadel 45s in the &#8217;80s, count on<br>
this fifty-track comp to yield repeated revelations. Unlike some<br>
regional compendiums that try to represent bands with one song,<br>
curator Dave Laing gives a great act like Younger&#8217;s New Christs<br>
three chances to knock you sideways. Disk one is slightly more<br>
garagey, spinning off from the twin impacts of Radio Birdman and<br>
the Saints through rare gems by the Psycho Surgeons, Fun Things,<br>
Lipstick Killers and Scientists. Disk two introduces the Died<br>
Pretty&#8217;s homegrown psychedelia, Lime Spiders&#8217; &#8217;60s punk primitivism,<br>
and the sublimely catchy Eastern Dark. With plenty of lesser-known<br>
acts like the Decline of the Reptiles, Someloves and Headstones,<br>
rare photos and fliers, informative liner notes and great ears<br>
informing the selection, this one&#8217;s a solid joy. Recommended.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> <i>Live from the Masque </i>CD (Bacchus Archives)<br>
Well, not exactly: this is a sampler from the two-night February<br>
&#8217;78 Masque benefit show at the MacArthur Park Elks&#8217; Lodge recorded<br>
on 4-track by Geza X. Lo-fi and historic, featuring the Weirdos,<br>
Bags, Germs, Skulls, Eyes, Dickies, F-Word, Alleycats, Zeroes,<br>
Randoms and Black Randy doing 1-3 songs each. Appearing at the<br>
shows but not represented here were the Dils, Controllers, Deadbeats,<br>
Shock, Arthur &quot;J&quot;, X and Flesheaters. Pick hit: the<br>
Eyes&#8217; pogo-perfect &quot;Go Go Bee.&quot;</p>

<p><b>V/A</b> <i>Teen Feeding Frenzy! A Tribute to the Music Teens<br>
Love</i> CD (Go-Kustom) Bubblegum / teen idol covers comp with<br>
styles encompassing punk, pop, country, industrial and just plain<br>
weird. What comes out is each band&#8217;s affection for the source<br>
material and the fun they&#8217;re having in the reworking.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> <i>A Tribute to Nashville</i> CD (Mint) Corn Sister<br>
Carolyn Marks and her pal Dave Lang are obsessed with the movie<br>
<i>Nashville</i>, and having forced most of their musician friends<br>
to watch it, compelled them to mount it as a stage show, and later<br>
to record this tribute. This disk features pretty much every celebrated<br>
Vancouverite in a down home vein, with music, dialogue and liner<br>
notes directing the listener to rent the DVD. That slowpoke Bangers<br>
&amp; Mash bassist keeps promising to loan me his copy-maybe he&#8217;ll<br>
hurry up if I offer this in trade?</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>V/A</b> <i>What&#8217;s the Use?!: 12 Tales of Teen Torment </i>LP<br>
(Corduroy) Tribute to the recently deceased Dean Mittelhauser,<br>
publisher of <i>The Living End</i> fanzine and promoter of lost<br>
Aussie sounds. The comp is drawn from his collection of rare acetates,<br>
and is strong throughout. Highlights: the Unknowns&#8217; unusual blend<br>
of surf drums and jangly guitars, a wonderfully inept and shambling<br>
attempt by the Rockin&#8217; Rogues, the soulful Pleazers, and strange<br>
and rather lovely call-and-response mood piece by the Liv&#8217;n&#8217; End.<br>
The LP winds up with a truly unbelievable track: the apparently<br>
pre-adolescent Leprechauns singing &quot;I think we should make<br>
love.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Volumizer</b> <i>gaga for gigi</i> CD (Mint) That rare successful<br>
blend of tough and sweet, post-punk guitar seasoned with tuneful<br>
girl harmonies, neither overwhelming the other.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Waistcoats</b> <i>Stark Raving Mod!</i> CD (Wildebeest)<br>
This Dutch neo-garage trio crosses between instro and vocal stylings,<br>
throwing some surfy guitar into the raw and crunchy mix. Covers<br>
include Jimmy Page&#8217;s early &quot;She Just Satisfies&quot; and<br>
an (inevitably) somewhat redundant &quot;Can&#8217;t Explain.&quot;<br>
Fine for fruggers.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Waistcoats</b> <i>Live @ KUT 90.5 FM</i> 45 EP (Wildebeest)<br>
Stopping off in Austin for a morning radio gig in 2001, the band<br>
sounds subdued on these four melodic, organ-drenched numbers,<br>
including an Outsiders&#8217; cover. Wonder what they sounded like the<br>
night before?</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Williams Brothers</b> <i>Andy &amp; David</i> CD (Var&egrave;se)<br>
This previously unreleased 1974 LP was made by the bowl-cutted<br>
twins under Michael Lloyd&#8217;s and Don Costa&#8217;s wings. In a precursor<br>
of his successful model for Shaun Cassidy, Lloyd trots out established<br>
Top 40 classics just creaky enough to be new to kids and nostalgic<br>
to their folks. The brothers&#8217; sweet harmonies blend with Costa&#8217;s<br>
arrangements into a wonderfully sunny, youthful sound, pure teenybop<br>
time capsule. Pick hit: &quot;Every Other Sunday,&quot; a startlingly<br>
topical song about kids torn apart by divorce.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Gary Wilson</b> <i>You Think You Really Know Me</i> CD (Motel)<br>
It&#8217;s good to live in a world where people take the trouble to<br>
do such a handsome reissue of a New Wave outsider art object like<br>
Gary Wilson&#8217;s album. Maybe they will even make money-after all,<br>
Beck name checked him. Gary Wilson is a lovable freak you wanna<br>
keep at arm&#8217;s length. From there you can gape at him grunting<br>
about timeless concerns like girls, kissing and dirty parties<br>
over a percolating backwash of synthesizers and funky bass. Imagine<br>
a retarded Steely Dan crossed with John Trubee if he ever let<br>
himself believe one of those snooty college girls might let him<br>
touch her tit. &quot;6.4 = Make Out&quot; especially is brain<br>
damaged perfection. When lured out of musical retirement-the scuttlebutt<br>
is he&#8217;s been working in a &quot;24 hour bookstore&quot;-for an<br>
early Knitting Factory Hollywood set in June, Wilson blew every<br>
mind in the room by coming out coated in flour and making violent<br>
love to a pair of nude mannequins, while a duct-tape wrapped manservant<br>
regularly emerged to whiten him further. His voice sounded even<br>
better than on the record, and you could almost taste the charisma<br>
oozing off of him. The backing band was tremendous, but they couldn&#8217;t<br>
detract from the evening&#8217;s clear star, still channeling insane<br>
passion for girls who might even be grandmas by now. One of the<br>
best half hours of rock and roll I&#8217;ve ever witnessed, and lets<br>
hope it&#8217;s not his last.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Link Wray &amp; the Wraymen</b> <i>Slinky! The Epic Sessions<br>
&#8217;58-&#8217;61</i> double CD (Sundazed) Here&#8217;s every little thing the<br>
raunchy string-bender and his trio waxed for Epic in the &quot;Raw-Hide&quot;<br>
era, including 17 unreleased tracks. Those slow and nasty instros<br>
are what put Link on the map, but don&#8217;t miss the scattering of<br>
nutso vocal turns. Batty good stuff.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Yardbirds</b> <i>Reunion Jam</i> CD (Mooreland Street) Taken from some<br>
    early nineties shows the Dreja/McCarty Yardbirds played in London, this set<br>
    shows the group sticking close to the raw sound fans dig, yet clearly stretching<br>
    out and enjoying themselves. This sounds a lot more like the Yardbirds than<br>
    you&#8217;d ever expect, given the absence of all those famous guitarists and Keith<br>
    Relf!</p>
