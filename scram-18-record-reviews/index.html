(all by the editrix unless otherwise noted)</p>
<p>David Ackles <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006RYIV/bubblegumbook">David Ackles</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006RYIW/bubblegumbook">Subway<br>
to the Country</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006RYIX/bubblegumbook">American<br>
Gothic</a></i> CDs (Collectors&#8217; Choice)&#8230; It&#8217;s always been hard<br>
to talk about Ackles in the context of modern pop music, but looking<br>
back at the five years spanned by these reissues of his first<br>
three releases on Elektra (from 1968-72), it&#8217;s no easier to put<br>
him in historical perspective. Whether your reference point is<br>
the singer-songwriter crowd of the period, the Jesse Winchester-type<br>
folkies, or the Laurel Canyon shitkickers, these records just<br>
don&#8217;t make sense. It gets worse when you try and shove him into<br>
some kind of concept artist ghetto with Van Dyke Parks or Lee<br>
Hazelwood. Except for <i>American Gothic,</i> where there is a<br>
musical and lyrical unity that comes the closest to a concept,<br>
these are records filled with story songs, but they don&#8217;t necessarily<br>
hang together. The standout tunes on <i>David Ackles</i> are &quot;The<br>
Road to Cairo,&quot; a traveling song with biblical overtones<br>
and &quot;Sonny Come Home&quot; which with its off-kilter American<br>
carny feel points the way toward <i>American Gothic.</i> The liner<br>
notes on the reissue try comparing such work to Kurt Weill, but<br>
once Ackles hit his stride on <i>Subway to the Country</i> the<br>
only thing I hear is mid-fifties Rodgers and Hammerstein. The<br>
sinister, melodramatic feel of <i>Picnic</i> is all over &quot;Candy<br>
Man,&quot; one of the better child molester ballads in anyone&#8217;s<br>
recorded cannon. Occasionally, as on <i>American Gothic&#8217;s</i><br>
&quot;Love&#8217;s Enough&quot; and &quot;One Night Stand,&quot; Ackles<br>
slips into a kind of mellow Neil Diamond lyricism which is pleasant<br>
enough, but not his strength. Instead, plow your way into the<br>
heart of <i>Gothic</i> and bathe in the pungent, hurdy-gurdy bombast<br>
of the title tune or &quot;The Ballad of the Ship of State&quot;<br>
or &quot;Midnight Carousel.&quot; It&#8217;s there you can witness the<br>
flowering of an iconoclastic vision from a time where a major<br>
label could at least temporarily find a place for something so<br>
amazingly out of place and time. (Ken Rudman)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mark Bacino</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000095J67/bubblegumbook">The Million Dollar Milkshake</a></i> CD (Parasol)&#8230; Shimmery hand-clappy<br>
tunes sure to please fans of Marshall Crenshaw and regional soda<br>
pops.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Frank Bango</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009ZYBC/bubblegumbook">The Unstudied Sea</a></i> CD (Sincere)&#8230; Mr. Bango and his partner<br>
Richy Vesecky specialize in sweet and witty pop ala Elvis Costello&#8217;s<br>
take on Bacharach-David, and it&#8217;s nicely realized here, if a bit<br>
samey.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Tywanna Jo Baskette</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000APVCX/bubblegumbook">Fancy Blue</a></i> CD (Sweet Tea)&#8230; This is one of those discs that&#8217;ll<br>
either charm the socks off you or make you run screaming out of<br>
the room. Baskette&#8217;s a genuine Southern oddball with a cracked,<br>
babyish voice and a sensibility to match. Her low-key, improvisational<br>
songs reveal a deeply personal mythoverse packed with strange<br>
animals, out-of-season flowers, the magic power of names and language,<br>
and always the shadow of death hanging overhead. &quot;1985/1998,&quot;<br>
an a cappella memorial for her parents, both dead of lung cancer,<br>
entwined with a rendering of the Winston jingle, is about as wrenching<br>
and lovely a listen as you&#8217;ll find. Baskette&#8217;s debut is precious,<br>
certainly, but it&#8217;s awfully good.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>birddog</b> <i>songs from willipa bay</i> CD (Karma)&#8230;<br>
Rangy, understated kosmic kountry, very pleasant.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Bobby Birdman</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000084U4W/bubblegumbook">Born Free Forever</a></i> CD (Hush)&#8230; Restrained, strained pop cycle<br>
ala Plush&#8217;s <i>More You Becomes You</i>-though not as catchy-distinguished<br>
by pretty if monotonous singing and a sense that this Birdman&#8217;s<br>
taking us nowhere in no particular hurry.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Black Keys</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008O31H/bubblegumbook">thickfreakness</a></i><br>
CD (Fat Possum)&#8230;The natural blues howl that Dan Auerbach channels<br>
on this raunchy, unpredictable set may be surprising coming out<br>
of his young, white throat, but it&#8217;s no less effecting for that.<br>
Feverish punk-blues with flavorful jolts of psych and funk.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Tony Borlotti &amp; I suoi Flauers <i>il mondo &Egrave;<br>
strano</i></b> LP (Teen Sound)&#8230; What does it say about the garage<br>
scene that it&#8217;s <i>this </i>refreshing to hear an overseas act<br>
sing in its native tongue? Tony and his pals play silly, upbeat<br>
folk rock with all the fuzz guitar, Farfisa abuse and snazzy harmonies<br>
you could possibly want, and would be a hoot to dance to.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Briefs</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000088E9P/bubblegumbook">Off the Charts</a></i> CD (Dirtnap)&#8230; Fun pop akin to Buzzcocks,<br>
Dickies, Oi bands and others featured on the gazillion punk comps<br>
released circa 1980. Strong songwriting skills and good sense<br>
of humor in lyrics, presentation and stage name. Perhaps a bit<br>
derivative for some, but if you can show me one band that you<br>
think isn&#8217;t these days, I&#8217;ll show you the suckers they ripped-off.<br>
There&#8217;s no reason the Briefs&#8217; video isn&#8217;t already on the MTV punk<br>
rock cycle except that they haven&#8217;t sold out to a big label&#8230;<br>
yet. When you do, guys, don&#8217;t let &quot;them&quot; change a thing.<br>
(Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Captain Beefheart and His Magic Bands</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000093D0S/bubblegumbook">Railroadism:<br>
Live in the USA 72-81</a></i> CD (Viper)&#8230; Following Viper&#8217;s<br>
comp of UK audience recordings comes a homeland bookend, featuring<br>
batty, impassioned takes on faves like &quot;The Blimp&quot; and<br>
&quot;Big Eyed Beans from Venus.&quot; The sound quality&#8217;s not<br>
bad considering the source(s), and live, the tunes hold together<br>
better than you&#8217;d think. For fans only, but they&#8217;ll be stoked.<br>
The title refers to a newly discovered blues vamp that evolves<br>
out of a long version of &quot;China Pig.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Chaino</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000083MGP/bubblegumbook"><i>New Sounds in Rock &#8216;N&#8217; Roll &#8211; Jungle Rock</i> </a>CD (Bacchus Archives)&#8230;<br>
Now that Chaino&#8217;s several years deceased, his pals at BA are spilling<br>
the bones that spell out the mysterious African percussionist&#8217;s<br>
true ID as Leon Johnson, late of Philly. These tracks were meant<br>
to cash in on the success of his manic Bagdasarian-damaged &quot;Pygmy<br>
Song,&quot; but that 1958 side didn&#8217;t do much and they were packed<br>
away to molder. Ignore the title-this is sleazy jazzbo dementia<br>
punctuated by lewd grunts &#8216;n&#8217; giggles, faux African invocations,<br>
and the sound of session guys giving in to all the excesses usually<br>
forbidden them. Half these tracks were previously available on<br>
scarce Tampa and Orb 45s.</p>
<p><b>Gene Clark <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006RYIQ/bubblegumbook">No Other</a></i></b> CD (Collector&#8217;s Choice)&#8230; The wayward Byrd<br>
never spent more on a record than on this coke-era L.A. artifact,<br>
a weird mix of Clark&#8217;s trademark yearning melodies and ambitious<br>
arrangements packed with gospel choruses, funk overlays and other<br>
excesses typical of folks living with 24 tracks and no curfew.<br>
There are some pretty songs, and I love the cover art, but as<br>
an album it&#8217;s a tough sell.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Cobra Verde</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008ZHT2/bubblegumbook">easy listening</a></i> CD (Muscletone)&#8230; How&#8217;re we ever gonna bury<br>
Rock&#8217;s suppurating corpse as long as these marvelous dopes insist<br>
on crawling inside and making it all sound great again? A personal-as-political<br>
glam fag testament that works on about eight simultaneous levels,<br>
every one a blast. See &#8217;em live.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Cuts</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000996GL/bubblegumbook">2 Over Ten</a></i> CD (Birdman)&#8230; On their second disc, the Cuts<br>
ply a smart, edgy sound reminiscent of Television, but warmer<br>
and poppier. &quot;Paradise&quot; is a sweet piece of early &#8217;70s<br>
fluff right out of Pete Ham&#8217;s pocket. If you can handle Andy Jordan&#8217;s<br>
strangled vocal stylings, there&#8217;s a lot of interesting stuff here.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jeff Dahl</b> <i>I Was a Teenage Glam-Fag Volume 2</i> CD<br>
(UU)&#8230; It&#8217;s clear from past releases that Jeff Dahl never got<br>
over the damage inflected by prolonged exposure to unpasteurized<br>
&#8217;70s cheese, and on this ltd. fan club issue he pays direct, trashy<br>
tribute to his fave glitter-daubed names (Lou, David, Marc) and<br>
never weres (Smokey, Berlin Brats). The results: good dirty fun.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Evan Dando </b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000089RVQ/bubblegumbook">Baby I&#8217;m Bored</a></i> CD (Bar/ None)&#8230; If you&#8217;re bored, baby, change<br>
careers because your heart doesn&#8217;t sound in it anymore. <i>Baby<br>
I&#8217;m Bored</i> falls short of the creative spark that made the<br>
Lemonheads beloved by their fan base. It&#8217;s weirdly uninteresting,<br>
like watching an ambulance speed by. He seems to want to be a<br>
contemplative or maybe &quot;adult contemporary&quot; singer-songwriter.<br>
While that worked for some old punks (Nick Cave) it totally failed<br>
for others (Paul Westerberg). Dando needs to get rid of all the<br>
yes-men in his life who agreed this was a great idea. (Margaret<br>
Griffis)</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Deadly Snakes</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008J2HO/bubblegumbook">Ode to Joy</a></i> CD (In The Red)&#8230; Hauty, sneering gospel / garage<br>
that stutters and veers like a high-powered engine run too long<br>
on the cheap stuff. Real loose and real wild.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Decembrists</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008XS4D/bubblegumbook">Castaways and Cutouts</a></i> CD (Kill Rock Stars)&#8230; Since KRS has mysteriously<br>
seen fit to reissue the Decembrists&#8217; year-old debut, I guess I&#8217;ll<br>
recycle the review I wrote when it was released on Hush: &quot;If<br>
the long silence of Neutral Milk Hotel chafes at you, try rubbing<br>
these marvelous Portlanders on the sore spot. I am charmed by<br>
their rollicking modernist sea chanteys peopled by ghostly infants,<br>
self-reflexive legionnaires, bedwetters and assorted oddballs.<br>
A Dame Darcy drawing on the cover is all that&#8217;s missing.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Decemberists</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008DKBN/bubblegumbook">5 Songs</a></i> CD-EP (Hush)&#8230; A fairly straightforward set from<br>
the jangly and mournful Portland magical pop realists, though<br>
&quot;My Mother was a Chinese Trapeze Artist&quot; charts them<br>
squarely back into zany waters. Extra track &quot;Apology Song&quot;<br>
is an appealing acknowledgment of a failure between friends and<br>
the inborn nobility of inanimate objects. A very odd and interesting<br>
band, though the vocals are a taste some won&#8217;t ever acquire.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Jonathan Donaldson &amp; The Color Forms</b> <i>Beyond Blue<br>
Bells </i>CD (Traveling Talons)&#8230; The debut by occasional Scram<br>
contributor Donaldson&#8217;s combo is an emotion-soaked trip on an<br>
anglophilic &#8217;80s rocket, with propulsive, clever tunes anchored<br>

<p><b>The Easybeats</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008NGHE/bubblegumbook">The Very Best of the Easybeats: Friday On My Mind </a></i>CD <i>(</i>Var&egrave;se<br>
Sarabande)&#8230; Sure, &quot;Friday On My Mind&quot; has been overplayed<br>
on Goldies stations worldwide, but comparing &quot;Friday&quot;<br>
to the rest of their tunes is like judging the Rolling Stones<br>
on the basis of &quot;She&#8217;s A Rainbow&quot; alone. This comp reveals<br>
a natural progression of styles paralleling the &#8217;60s in general<br>
but without the insane commercial success of a Stones or Beatles.<br>
&quot;Sorry,&quot; &quot;The Music Goes Round My Head&quot; and<br>
&quot;Bring A Little Lovin&#8217;&quot; are just three of the should&#8217;ve-beens<br>
that oughtta crowd out the Motown infesting AM today. Too heavy<br>
for &#8217;60s throwback radio, I guess. Easybeats Vanda and Young were<br>
musical nursemaids to Young&#8217;s little pipsqueak brothers who went<br>
on to form AC/DC. If that ain&#8217;t street cred&#8230; (Margaret Griffis)</p>

<p><b>Electric Turn To Me</b> <i>S/T</i> CD-EP (No Quarter)&#8230;<br>

French</a></i> CD (Dischord)&#8230; Electro post punk dragged through<br>
an indie rock/ Fugazi filter, not bad if you dig the California<br>
weird crowd like the Residents, Centimeters, Screamers and electro<br>
pop ala early Depeche Mode. They&#8217;re affected by DC/ Dischord,<br>
but not in a heavy-handed way. Fairly interesting, though I found<br>
the repetitiveness of some of the songs irritating on second and<br>
third play-which doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t absolutely love it. (Margaret<br>

<p><b>Ron Elliott</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000095IWU/bubblegumbook">The<br>
Candlestickmaker</a></i> CD (Collector&#8217;s Choice)&#8230; Sole solo<br>
outing from the Beau Brummels&#8217; chief songwriter and guitarist,<br>
here backed by Chris Ethridge, Dennis Dragon and assorted session<br>
cats. Elliott&#8217;s no Sal Valentino, and his gruff vocals can&#8217;t enliven<br>
these dirgelike country-folk tunes, which lack the inspired magical<br>
realism of the <i>Triangle/ Bradley&#8217;s</i> era. There&#8217;s some nice<br>
picking and typically classy Waronker stable arrangements, but<br>
just too little in the way of hooks and energy. As a solo artist,<br>
Ron Elliott is one hell of a sideman.</p>

<i>S/T</i></a> CD (Dirtnap)&#8230; It&#8217;s rarely acknowledged, but the<br>
most startling accomplishment of the first new wave was that it<br>
momentarily made yodeling cool-Lene Lovich, anyone?-and neo-wave<br>
siren Roxy Epoxy and her compadres give the gimmick another shot<br>
with their stylish, catchy and surprisingly sincere sound.</p>

You Swing?</a> </i>CD (Yep Roc)&#8230; The last &#8216;tones disc I heard<br>
was disconcertingly &quot;mature,&quot; with lyrics suggesting<br>
these longtime party rockers had settled into straight jobs and<br>
comfy relationships. The garage revival has roused them from their<br>
languor to turn in a trashy, jangly set more in keeping with fans&#8217;<br>
expectations. While they rarely come up with a great hook, this<br>
is solid, nicely produced foolishness that will give them a welcome<br>
excuse to hit te road again.</p>

<p><b>Freddy &amp; the Four Gone Conclusions</b> <i>Wigged Out<br>

&amp; Maltese are no more, but Freddy Fortune&#8217;s back with a new<br>
outfit that knock out more of that utterly convincing retro rock<br>
that makes the kids dance funny. Shame-on-you-girl lyrics, check.<br>
Sneery vocal action, check. Matching suits-canary yellow, no less-check.<br>
All kindsa organ, check. Someone dust off the temporal skip panel<br>

<p><b>Bobbie Gentry</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006C2P9/bubblegumbook">An<br>
American Quilt 1967-1974</a></i> CD (Raven)&#8230; This is a revelation.<br>
If, like me, all you knew of Bobbie G. was &quot;Ode to Billie<br>
Joe,&quot; you&#8217;re likely to be gob-smacked by the lady&#8217;s sure<br>
and striking amalgam of country, soul and subtle psychedelia.<br>
Gentry was raised in Mississippi, studied philosophy at UCLA and<br>
worked as a Vegas showgirl, and these apparently contradictory<br>
experiences prove surprisingly cohesive in her art. The regional<br>
portraiture is imbued with a rich psychological understanding<br>
and a streak of dark and giddy humor, her voice is warm and knowing,<br>
and the arrangements terrific. From the erotic maternalism of<br>
&quot;Jessye&#8217; Lisabeth&quot; to the arch &quot;Casket Vignette&quot;<br>
to &quot;Fancy,&quot; the irresistible tale of a streetwalker&#8217;s<br>
rise to semi respectability, this Australian comp (composed almost<br>
exclusively of Gentry&#8217;s originals) should go a long way towards<br>
restoring the reputation of a mysteriously neglected singer-songwriter.<br>
Highly recommended, nay, essential.</p>

<p><b>Hearts and Flowers </b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006RYJ7/bubblegumbook">The<br>
Complete</a></i> double CD (Collector&#8217;s Choice)&#8230; In the late<br>
&#8217;60s, Hearts and Flowers&#8217; spare country-folk made them an oddity<br>
on the L.A. scene, and, while perfectly pleasant, their two Nik<br>
Venet produced Capitol discs failed to sell them to a larger audience.<br>
There&#8217;s nothing extraordinary here, but if your tastes run to<br>
close harmonies and down home versions of Donovan and Goffin-King<br>
tunes, it&#8217;s well worth a spin. Disk two is mainly unreleased,<br>
unfinished material, including an interesting, disjointed take<br>
on Phil Ochs&#8217; &quot;Flower Lady.&quot; Late member Bernie Leadon<br>
was a founding Eagle.</p>

<p><b>The High Dials</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A4GDW/bubblegumbook">A<br>
New Devotion</a></i> CD (Rainbow Quartz)&#8230; Rainbow Quartz specializes<br>
in quality contemporary psych, and disc #2 from this Montreal<br>
act is one of their best picks yet, an Eastern-inflected concept<br>
album that keeps the concept (man struggles to escape from nightmarish<br>
city) refreshingly low-key. The energy level suggests the Jam,<br>
but a dreamy Sunday morning Jam you can spread on your crumpets.<br>
Yum.</p>

<p><b>Dotti Holmberg</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068FVP/bubblegumbook"><i>Sometimes<br>
Happy Times</i> </a>CD (Sundazed)&#8230; Ms. Holmberg was an early<br>
Curt Boettcher collaborator (one of the black haired gypsies backing<br>
up the Greenwich Village GoldeBriars) with a breathy little girl<br>
voice that could give Boettcher&#8217;s sunshine pop confections the<br>
extra dash of powdered sugar required to send them over the top.<br>
On its own, that voice is too sweet to take in large doses, but<br>
for a track or two it&#8217;s charming. This disc compiled unreleased<br>
solo Dotti tracks recorded at Columbia during the Millennium era,<br>
plus some home demos.</p>

<p><b>The Incredible String Band </b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006BC4Y/bubblegumbook">U</a></i><br>
double CD (Collector&#8217;s Choice)&#8230; Studio recreation of the ISB&#8217;s<br>
1970 theatrical presentation which played briefly at London&#8217;s<br>
Roundhouse and the Fillmore East. On stage, the band was augmented<br>
by Stone Monkey, a troupe that evolved out of happenings artist<br>
/ bubble sculptor David Medalla&#8217;s Exploding Galaxy. <i>U</i> is<br>
a musical mishmash, with the band&#8217;s usual eclectic hobbit meandering<br>
grafted to old timey fiddle-fueled wackiness, robotic laments<br>
and mysterious invocations. Very weird and unpredictable, but<br>
it obviously loses a lot from the absence of the visual element.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Insect Surfers</b> <i>Mojave Reef</i> CD (Marlin)&#8230; After<br>
nearly 25 years honoring the instrumental surf traditions while<br>
striking off on their own abstract melodic trails, the Surfers&#8217;<br>
third disc is just the warm, high energy blast you&#8217;d expect. Close<br>
your eyes and see spies, fast cars, huge swells and swirling colors<br>
shifting almost too fast to register.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Insta</b> <i>Checklist for Love</i> CD (Sunday)&#8230; Fine<br>

On Your Mean Side</a></i> CD (Rough Trade)&#8230; Hipswing minimalist<br>
punk-blues that veers between snotty, sexy and annoying, pretty<br>
much in that order. The latter&#8217;s largely due to pointless spoken<br>
asides delivered in that bored Kim Gordon fashion, throwing a<br>
wet towel over otherwise cool twining boy/girl vocals and low-fi<br>
guitar rumble.</p>

<p><b>The Lazily Spun </b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008S806/bubblegumbook">S/T</a></i><br>
CD (Camera Obscura)&#8230; Reunion of the mid-&#8217;90s Manchester DIY<br>
psych act whose demos gained support from the <i>Ptolemaic Terrascope</i><br>
crowd. Slow, moody layers of very English melancholia, with occasional<br>
found sounds, Indian instruments and theremin. I like that these<br>
guys are <i>professional</i> psychedelicians-the bassist does<br>
post-graduate MDMA research, and their name derives from early<br>
acid and mescaline experiments on spiders. But I don&#8217;t like the<br>
ugly stoned doodles on the cover, ugh.</p>

<p><b>Let&#8217;s Active</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009PBGG/bubblegumbook">Cypress/<br>
Afoot</a> </i>(Collector&#8217;s Choice) This disc plugs a big hole<br>
in the &#8217;80s Southern jangle pop revival. Let&#8217;s Active was formed<br>
in Chapel Hill in 1981 by Mitch Easter, a Dixie wonder boy who,<br>
with future dB Chris Stamey, had a long stint during the &#8217;70 in<br>
Sneakers (another influential, long dead power pop act whose catalog<br>
badly wants a reissue), before going on to produce R.E.M.&#8217;s first<br>
single &quot;Radio Free Europe,&quot; their <i>Chronic Town</i><br>
EP and the epochal <i>Murmur</i>. The demos that became the brilliant<br>
1983 <i>Afoot </i>EP evoke the frothy, pessimistic, dancing-on-the-deck<br>
atmosphere of the Southern early &#8217;80s. Easter&#8217;s sweet-boy vocals<br>
on &quot;Every Word Means No&quot; and &quot;Leader of Men&quot;<br>
glided ecstatically on power pop&#8217;s dazzling membrane stretched<br>
tight over general disaster. 1984&#8217;s <i>Cypress</i> should&#8217;ve been<br>
the band&#8217;s breakout-twelve exuberant nightmares comparable to<br>
Dramarama&#8217;s <i>Cinema Verite</i> and sweetly gloomy as Georgia<br>
mist. The band took to unsuccessful commerce for the next two<br>
albums (also available on Collector&#8217;s Choice) before dying in<br>
obscurity in 1988. This is my odds-on favorite for reissue of<br>
the year. (Ron Garmon)</p>
<p><b>Richard Lloyd </b><i><a><br>

</a>CD (Collector&#8217;s Choice)&#8230; After Television broke up, Elektra<br>
cannily kept both guitarists on with solo deals, and while the<br>
results were hardly as anxiously thrilling as <i>Marquee Moon</i>,<br>
Lloyd and Verlaine&#8217;s 1979 debuts are each worth hearing. Verlaine&#8217;s<br>
is closest to Television, with nervous, obtuse, jittering tunes<br>
that betray a deep vein of silliness. The songs on the original<br>
side two (&quot;Flash Lightning&quot; through &quot;Breakin&#8217; in<br>
My Heart&quot;) are the most serious and striking, and had their<br>
mood been maintained over the course of the disc it might have<br>
made more of a splash. Coming to it as a Television fan soon after<br>
its release, I found <i>Alchemy</i> a startling surprise. Richard<br>
Lloyd, the pretty boy who stood in the shadows behind Verlaine,<br>
turned out to be an excellent pop songwriter with a lazily cool<br>
performance style, kind of like a softer-edged Johnny Thunders.<br>
The disc is catchy, jangly and heartfelt, with some terrifically<br>
inventive guitar playing.</p>

<p><b>The Lovin&#8217; Spoonful</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000894OW/bubblegumbook"><i>Hums<br>
of</i> </a>CD (Buddha/ BMG)&#8230; When I was a gnash-toothed teenage<br>
record clerk, one of my co-workers made it a habit to try and<br>
convince me of the genius of his pet band, but while I loved &quot;Summer<br>
in the City,&quot; I couldn&#8217;t get past the faux-na&iuml;f cover<br>
of <i>Everything Playing</i> and the <i>Kotter</i> theme. Now<br>
I&#8217;m probably older than that seemingly doddering fellow, and damned<br>
if he wasn&#8217;t right! Album #3 (originally issued by Kama Sutra<br>
in &#8217;66) is as warm and charming and genuine and rocking a set<br>
as any group issued in that sparkling year. A stone delight, with<br>
bonus tracks.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Lulu</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000089Y9L/bubblegumbook">To<br>
Sir With Love: The Best of 1967-1968</a></i> CD (Taragon)&#8230; Lulu<br>
packed a lot of recording into her first couple years on Epic,<br>
where under Mickie Most&#8217;s tutelage she knocked out some fine tracks.<br>
But was she the snarling little rocker chick discovered grooving<br>
with the Luvvers in Glasgow, or an idiosyncratic soul belter with<br>
an air of continental sophistication? You&#8217;ll find both Lulus here,<br>
and it&#8217;s a treat to see the woman emerging from the little girl<br>
persona of the title track. And while the orchestral stuff&#8217;s fun<br>
in an Anthony-Newley-in-drag kinda way, it&#8217;s as a rocker that<br>
Lulu most impresses. Highlights include her fabulously miffed<br>
reworking of &quot;Day Tripper,&quot; a haunted, desolate &quot;Morning<br>
Dew,&quot; and the defiantly un-pretty &quot;Love Loves to Love<br>
Love.&quot;</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Maharajas </b><i>h-minor</i> LP (Teen Sound) Jens Lindberg<br>
(the Swedish Russell Quan) leads these gloomstruck purveyors of<br>
minor key folk rock revivalism, replete with Beatley oooos and<br>
a positively Blue Things style raver &quot;Anything Right&quot;<br>
(as in &quot;I can&#8217;t do&quot;). Not the real thing, but a most<br>
tasteful imitation.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mando Diao</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AM6NK/bubblegumbook">bring<br>
&#8217;em in</a></i> CD (Mute) Kinda interesting young Swedish combo<br>
mixing sixties pop and r&amp;b influences with more commercial<br>
contemporary hard rock and punk sounds, all over the place and<br>
unsure of their strengths. Main weakness: one of the two singing<br>
guitarists has a decent grasp of English, but the other uh she<br>
is not so goodly spoken.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Many Birthdays</b> <i>35 Minutes</i> CD (Red Cake) Textured,<br>
whispery, subterranean loops and outsider singalongs. Sounds like<br>
the music discarded dolls might make in the dumpster.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Mensen</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008S7ZD/bubblegumbook">Oslo<br>
City</a></i> CD (Gearhead) Deliciously energetic union of buzzsaw<br>
guitars, bored girl vocals and a punk + Detroit sensibility that<br>
reminds me a little of the &#8217;80s Sydney scene. Solid kicks.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Milo</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AS8PR/bubblegumbook">Darkside<br>
of the Rumours</a></i> CD (Gloomy Tunes) Milo is a little bit<br>
country, 5% goth, a bit avant-pop, and all unpredictable. From<br>
the &quot;peel it and see&quot; banana cover parody to the nifty<br>
version of Shari Elf&#8217;s &quot;Happy World&quot; to the low-key<br>
incest ballad, you never know what&#8217;ll be subverted next. Many<br>
of these could be tagged as novelty songs-Dr. Demento plays Milo<br>
music-but the gag is never telescoped.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Monster Island</b> <i>Dream Tiger</i> CD (End is Near) While<br>
we don&#8217;t usually review older stuff, this 2001 disc is so gloriously<br>
haunted, rhythmic and childlike that an exception must be made.<br>
Using oud, harmonium, sitar, toy piano and something called Chinese<br>
organ, in addition to the usual rock instrumentation, the band<br>
unfurls each song like a found fairy tale gene spliced with the<br>
most exotic of flowers. The results are most lovely and imaginative.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Monster Island &amp; John Sinclair</b> <i>Peyotemind</i><br>
CD (End is Near) Time is the least of our concerns here, but let&#8217;s<br>
review. Some while before he transformed an Ann Arbor garage band<br>
into a ten-legged, tongue-wagging symbol of socio-political confrontation<br>
(MC5), John Sinclair kept a handwritten journal of his peyote<br>
observations, a document that was later deposited in a local archive.<br>
Monster Island&#8217;s Cary Loren uncovered the text and its related<br>
series of poems, and conceived this free form musical backdrop<br>
over which Sinclair intones his nearly forty-year-old texts. The<br>
result: thought-provoking jazzy psychedelia, seasoned with spookhouse<br>
Moog and a sense of delicate spaciousness.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The New Christs</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000B2TOA/bubblegumbook">We<br>
Got This!</a> </i>CD (Laughing Outlaw import, Smog Veil domestic)<br>
Rob Younger says this is the last New Christs record. We&#8217;ve heard<br>
that before, but the paranoid mess described in a recent <i>Bucketful<br>
of Brains</i> interview certainly seems to guarantee that <i>this</i><br>
version of the band won&#8217;t be back. They leave as proof of their<br>
existence a rough, angry disk in the New Christs distinctive,<br>
swaggering style. There aren&#8217;t many singers who can make cynicism<br>
sound like fun, but when Younger turns his tonsils to denunciation<br>
the results are positively inspiring. Let&#8217;s hear it for hatred!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The New Creation </b><i>Troubled</i> CD (Companion) One<br>
of my favorite stops on the web is www.showandtellmusic.com, with<br>
its galleries of offbeat cover art. Webmaster Will Louviere was<br>
so blown away by the sole, self-released 1970 album by these Vancouver<br>
Jesus People, he started a label to reissue it. <i>Troubled</i><br>
starts off with a disturbing four-minute sound collage in which<br>
old and young male and female voices intone snippets reflecting<br>
contemporary political, cultural and religious thought over war<br>
sounds and outer space echo effects. Wild! But it&#8217;s their shambling<br>
garagey originals that have made this a much-traded CDR. The New<br>
Creation weren&#8217;t particularly skilled musicians-I&#8217;m being generous-but<br>
their love of the Lord let them put self-consciousness aside to<br>
share their belief in a new form of revolutionary Christianity.<br>
The main vocalist is the guitarist&#8217;s mom, and the effect of her<br>
mature, British-tinged vocals over the primitive drumming and<br>
guitar is truly strange. Pick hit: &quot;No Excuse,&quot; with<br>
its jaw-dropping lyrics blaming the older generation for providing<br>
heroin, whiskey and war to innocent kids. If you always wished<br>
the Shaggs were more spiritually minded-and I figure if such a<br>
person exists, they read Scram-this is for you.</p>

third of this Birmingham pop juggernaut, formerly led the excellent<br>
Three Finger Cowboy. Their warm, smart songs have a folky coziness<br>
even at their most fierce and prickly. Cool and weird.</p>

<p><b>Jerry J. Nixon</b> <i>Gentleman of Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll: The Q-Recordings,<br>
New Mexico &#8217;58-&#8217;64 </i>CD (Voodoo Rhythm) Man, what a story! Failed<br>
teenage bank robber Gerald Hall splits Yorkshire with the merchant<br>
marine, turning up in the US with a ridiculous accent, claiming<br>
he&#8217;s a Minnesotan who lost his passport. Some wit in the Customs<br>
Office went for it, and &quot;Nixon&quot; migrated down southwest,<br>
where he joined the Communist Party (for the dames and conversation)<br>
and recorded these deliriously amateurish, yet truly inspired<br>
rockabilly sides with a local band called the Volcanoes. JJ wasn&#8217;t<br>
a great singer, but with that pedigree you just know he could<br>
<i>sell</i> a tune. This cool comp has all the 45s from the Q<br>
label, previously unreleased live cuts and demos and some hilarious<br>
radio spots with JJ&#8217;s remarkable &quot;New Mexican&quot; accent<br>
on display.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Operators</b> <i>Citizens Band</i> CD (Unstoppable)<br>
Boston&#8217;s Operators are flagship members of the Handstand Command,<br>
a small, loose-knit group of friends and musical associates. They<br>
play in each other&#8217;s bands and set up residencies in local clubs.<br>
I think more bands should do this-get together, take on a catchy<br>
name and form their own gangs. Certainly <i>Citizens Band</i>,<br>
the Operators&#8217; debut, is infused with that spirit of rambunctious<br>
friendship. You&#8217;ll feel an instant sense of rapport with these<br>
three gals and one guy, as if they were people you see at shows<br>
and bars all the time. The chugging guitars, ragged &#8216;n&#8217; bittersweet<br>
melodies and raspy harmonies are reminiscent of early Scrawl,<br>
while the song structures and call-and-response vocals (more like<br>
&quot;yell-and-response&quot; on the title track and &quot;Rock<br>
City&quot;) betray a Sleater-Kinney influence. Occasionally a<br>
Flying Nun/New Zealand feel shines through-particularly in &quot;Running<br>
Late,&quot; with woozy tempo and acoustic guitars straight out<br>
of the Look Blue Go Purple songbook. A couple of songs don&#8217;t quite<br>
coalesce, but as a whole <i>Citizens Band</i> is impressive and<br>
addictive. (Mike Appelstein)</p>

CD (Dionysus) Convincingly &#8217;56-sounding set of exotica originals<br>

bassist Palmer took a few hours from his busy schedule quitting<br>
bands and getting deported for possession to record this improvisational<br>
psych-jazz ramble with Rick James, Big Black and members of the<br>
west coast Kaleidoscope. Barely released by Verve in &#8217;71 and subject<br>
to a scathing Lester Bangs review in <i>Rolling Stone,</i> thirty-plus<br>
years on it reads as a playful, Eastern-tinged jam that&#8217;s surprisingly<br>
listenable considering the sheer volume of individual instruments<br>
(including wayyyy too much flute) battling for attention. A very<br>
neat rediscovery.</p>

<p><b>Pearlene</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008XS41/bubblegumbook">Murder<br>
Blues and Prayer</a> </i>CD (Dim Mak) Soledad Brothers side project<br>
with a meaty, energetic blues-punk sound, and a sensibility closer<br>
to Detroit party rock than porch-sittin&#8217; bellyachin&#8217;.</p>

<p><b>Linda Perhacs </b><i>Parallelograms</i> CD (The Wild Places)<br>
I&#8217;ve been obsessed with this gorgeous 1970 record since finding<br>
it at a yard sale a couple years back. This expanded edition,<br>
taken from the artist&#8217;s original masters, makes the Kapp LP sound<br>
like the Kansas scenes in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> look<i>.</i><br>
Delicate little effects trill around the edges, building to crescendos<br>
of rattling sonic force, and always there&#8217;s Linda&#8217;s gently layered<br>
voice, praising the rain and the rocks and the river, erotic,<br>
exquisitely simple, utterly original. The title track especially<br>
is a psychedelic classic, a multi-tracked crazy quilt celebrating<br>
shapes and their qualities before segueing into some of the most<br>
ghostly, weird sounds ever put on tape. <i>Parallelograms</i><br>
really sounds like my baby memories of Venice and driving up the<br>
coast in the bread van my hippie folks outfitted as a temporary<br>
home. Wind chimes, soft winds, swirling colors and magic made<br>
manifest. Bonus tracks include alternate takes and demos, Linda&#8217;s<br>
narrated tape of potential manipulated sound effects for producer<br>
Leonard Rosenman, and two versions of a surprisingly poppy, unreleased<br>
song, &quot;If You Were My Man,&quot; that could almost be a Carpenters<br>
outtake. Watch for our interview with Linda in the next <i>Scram</i>.<br>

<p><b>The Petals </b><i>Butterfly Mountain</i> CD (Camera Obscura)<br>
First release in nine years from Milwaukee neo-psych outfit whose<br>

Incredible String Band.</p>

3-Dimensional In Pop-Cycle Dream</a></i> CD (Proverus) The first<br>
cut sounds so much like the Lemon Pipers it&#8217;s scary-could Ohio<br>
still be hiding a secret stash of great bubblegum acts? The other<br>
songs don&#8217;t sound so Pipery, more like tasteful, impressively<br>
realized UK-obsessed pop-psych with a hint of prog. The singing,<br>
so often the weak spot on such projects, is strong throughout.<br>
Plus the CD comes with a custom ViewMaster reel!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>The Poets </b><i>Surrealistic Rain</i> LP (Teen Sound) This<br>
contemporary Italian trio (no relation to the legendary Scots)<br>
have sixties pop ambitions that veer from early Searchers beat<br>
to &quot;Midas&quot;-era Hollies, and if their reach exceeds their<br>
grasp, you gotta respect &#8217;em for trying-plus they write all their<br>
own songs. The blend of accented English vocals, oddly lush instrumentation<br>
and sudden tempo changes gives the whole affair a weird air akin<br>
to riding a carousel on heavy meds. None of the other revivalists<br>
sounds a bit like &#8217;em.</p>

<p><b>Alasdair Roberts</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008XEQ0/bubblegumbook">Farewell<br>
Sorrow</a></i> CD (Drag City) Ancient-sounding courtly balladry<br>
from the Appendix Out leader. Some tunes are partly adapted from<br>
traditional British songs, and chords and capo positions are provided,<br>
but the lyrical abstractions and ghostly orchestration place it<br>
nearer to postmodern pop than trad folk.</p>

assuming you&#8217;re looking for snotnosed contempo organ splat that&#8217;d<br>
fit just fine on a <i>Back from the Grave</i> comp. If Nicky Shutdown<br>
had been around in his beloved &#8217;66, five hundred bands called<br>

<p><b>Sidonie</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006GA0F/bubblegumbook">let<br>
it flow</a></i> CD (Rainbow Quartz) Spacious, whispery Britpop/psych<br>
from Spain, laced with traditional Indian instruments and Byrdsy<br>
harmonies. An attempt to reclaim Madonna&#8217;s Love-steal &quot;Beautiful<br>
Stranger&quot; is unfortunately accented by shrill synth lines,<br>
but overall this is a warm and pretty selection.</p>

<p><b>Simply Saucer </b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000093NRS/bubblegumbook">Cyborgs<br>
Revisited</a></i> CD (Sonic Unyon) One leg clad in post-Warhol<br>
Velvet, the other teetering somewhere between psyched-out space<br>
rock and Stoogey primitivism, these Cannucks made sounds too delightfully<br>
wobbly to fly when initially launched (&#8217;73-79), though a posthumous<br>
LP blew a lot of influential minds in the late &#8217;80s. This comp<br>
brings that disc together with the legendary early 45s plus previously<br>
unreleased demos and live cuts, and it&#8217;s an absolute gas, retroactively<br>
sounding positively sophisticated, in a brain damaged kinda way.</p>

Nut Gone Flake</i> CD (Fuel 2000) The Small Faces&#8217; final disc<br>
is a schizophrenic affair, kicking off with six scrumptious rockers,<br>
layered like some tottering sonic trifle, the whole thing suffused<br>
with pot smoke instead of sherry. Part two smells more like hash<br>
oil, with its meandering thematic fantasy narrated by babbling<br>
Brit comic Stan Unwin, leading into disjointed jolts of psychedelia<br>
that lack the band&#8217;s usual tautness and melodicism. Too bad they<br>
felt they had to compete with the Beatles and Who in the concept<br>
stakes, especially since they were so deeply out of their element.<br>
This reish includes some strong live tracks recorded at a November<br>
1968 show in Newcastle, accompanied by screaming teenies.</a></p>

<p><b>Soledad Brothers</b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000060MOC/bubblegumbook"><i>Steal<br>
Your Soul and Dare Your Spirit to Move</i> </a>CD (Estrus) Another<br>
set of mostly tough and swaggering white boy blues from the Toledo<br>
three-piece, the kind of record that makes good background music<br>
but doesn&#8217;t require serious attention. Still, &quot;This Guitar<br>
Says I&#8217;m Sorry&quot; is a surprisingly pretty folk-tinged instro,<br>
and a couple other cuts have that sleepy late Velvets vibe.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Soltero</b> <i>Defrocked and Kicking the Habit</i> CD (Handsome)<br>
Loping lo-fi minimalist country-folk / indie-rock, fully loaded<br>
with banjo and apologies.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Sun Zoom Spark</b> <i>Electricity</i> CD (SlowBurn) Eclectic,<br>
intriguing blend of loping &#8217;70s stoner rock, hypno-exoticism and<br>
tape collage, compiled by an insular trio of Tucson four-trackers,<br>
later associated with Black Sun Ensemble. Originally released<br>
in 1999 in an edition of thirty copies, this repressing is sure<br>
to please fans of homegrown psychedelia and unselfconscious thud.</p>

Eye World</i> </a>CD (Career) Career is a new label founded by<br>
Deniz Tek and Donovan&#8217;s Brain leader Ron Sanchez as an outlet<br>
for their recent recordings that don&#8217;t fit elsewhere, and this<br>
is certainly a raw little morsel, partly live and live in the<br>
studio. The Golden Breed features Deniz&#8217; American touring band,<br>
the Godoy twins, and their U.K. punk influences get spliced onto<br>
Deniz&#8217; languid guitar mystics with unexpected results. Closer<br>
&quot;Baja Confidential&quot; is a classic spaced-out DT instro.</p>

<p><b>The Telepathic Butterflies</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008O6DZ/bubblegumbook">Introducing</a></i><br>
CD (Rainbow Quartz) Familiar but enjoyable Beatle/ Floydesque<br>
jangle pop, the band name and record jacket cribbed from Vonnegut&#8217;s<br>
<i>Breakfast of Champions</i>. Includes a cover of Donovan&#8217;s &quot;Epistle<br>

Music</a></i> CD (Rev-Ola) <i>Id Music</i> is the result of teen<br>
songwriter Joey Levine&#8217;s initial collaboration with older husband<br>
and wife writing team Kris and Artie Resnick. Joey was a hungry,<br>
talented kid, Artie had had some success in the Brill Building,<br>
penning &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; and &quot;Good Lovin&#8217;,&quot;<br>
while Kris brought a classically trained sensibility to the proceedings.<br>
Their sole Epic LP is an unpredictable melange of delicate chamber<br>
pop, politically charged lyrics and goofball satire. Joey sings<br>
almost entirely in a punky falsetto, avoiding the nasal tones<br>
that would make him a bubblegum sensation. The Resnick-Levine<br>
partnership would later yield smash Buddah singles like &quot;Yummy<br>
Yummy Yummy,&quot; but this Third Rail music has its own daffy<br>
charms. The comp includes all the 45 mixes and informative liner<br>
notes.</p>

that they took the collective surname Sinclair-though they eschew<br>

<p><b>Townes Van Zandt</b> <i>In The Beginning</i> CD (Compadre)<br>
Lots of cool new Townes releases lately, including these rediscovered<br>
1966 solo recordings that predate Townes&#8217; debut album by two years.<br>
He already sounds like a mature artist, alternately positioning<br>
himself as raunchy bluesman and folk romancer. The songs aren&#8217;t<br>
masterpieces, but solid compositions that obviously belong in<br>
the body of work. A major find, despite some problems with tape<br>
hiss.<br>

HREF=&#8221;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007JGTU/bubblegumbook&#8221;>Our<br>
Mother the Mountain</a><br></i> CD (Tomato) TVZ&#8217;s 1969 second record,<br>
where lush arrangements cushion his plainspoken country-folk originals.<br>
At this stage Townes was already capable of penning an iconic<br>
piece of poetry like &quot;Tecumseh Valley,&quot; a stark inversion<br>
of the humorous American motif of the doomed miner&#8217;s daughter<br>
Clementine rendered here as Caroline, who deliberately becomes<br>
a whore from grief. The rest of the material is strong lyrically<br>
and quite beautifully sung, but suffers from simple, samey tunes<br>
causing the songs to blend into a piece. Quite listenable and<br>
a must for fans, but better things were to come.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Townes Van Zandt</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007MB6D/bubblegumbook">Delta<br>
Momma Blues</a></i> CD (Tomato) While the cover photo&#8217;s a classic<br>
in hippie kitsch (a smirking Townes leans on some steps with <i>The<br>
Last Unicorn</i> poking out of his suede pocket, as a pair of<br>
grimy, androgynous love children grope behind him), this is deep,<br>
dark stuff, not cute at all. Townes drank, and he had demons that<br>
yanked him around by his hair whenever he got too close to happiness.<br>
<i>DMB</i> is a portrait of the great American fuck up, yearning<br>
for grace, failing every time, and documenting his flaws with<br>
wry, elegant precision. Townes&#8217; fourth disc contains some of his<br>
most philosophical songs, including misfit waltz &quot;Tower Song,&quot;<br>
and &quot;Nothin&#8217;,&quot; an existential boot to the skull. And<br>
then there&#8217;s &quot;Rake,&quot; a Beaudelaire-by-way-of-Hogarth<br>
fantasy of a reprobate whose spiritual and physical decay culminate<br>
in vampirism. Sure it&#8217;s just the blues, but as literate, startling<br>
and refined a blues as we&#8217;re likely to get. And we think you should<br>
hear it, so when Tomato offered us one of their TVZ reissues for<br>
new subscribers, this is the one we picked. See the last page<br>
for details, and reserve yours quick.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Townes Van Zandt</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007JGTY/bubblegumbook">Flyin&#8217;<br>
Shoes</a></i> CD (Tomato) Townes took a long break from recording<br>
in the mid-seventies, and when he went back into the studio with<br>
Chips Moman, he had a fine set of songs on hand. Some folks shy<br>
away from the more heavily produced TVZ discs, and certain early<br>
Poppy albums did go overboard with strings, but Moman&#8217;s crew-including<br>
Randy Scruggs, Spooner Oldham and Moman&#8217;s wife Toni Wine-forge<br>
a sympathetic framing for these tender, taut ballads with their<br>
lonesome, Southwestern feel. Side two of the LP has been resequenced<br>
to start this remaster, which I&#8217;ve got no problem with, as that&#8217;s<br>
the way I usually play the record. Apparently I ain&#8217;t the only<br>
one.</p>

<p><b>Townes Van Zandt</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068Q0G/bubblegumbook">The<br>
Nashville Sessions</a></i> CD (Tomato) This is all wrong: sleepy,<br>
sweetened 1993 rerecordings of some of Townes&#8217; best songs that<br>
just make me long for the stark originals. Townes sounds like<br>
he&#8217;s medicated, the chorus is annoying and the arrangements suck<br>
every bit of soul from the material. I really hope no one ever<br>
makes this their first TVZ purchase.</p>

has put out several song-poem anthologies over the years, but<br>
this latest set, compiled by American Song-Poem Music Archives<br>
curator Phil Milstein, is a good single-disk introduction to the<br>
genre. The focus is on the weirder juxtapositions of &quot;lyric&quot;<br>
and performance, with brain bogglers from masters Rodd Keith,<br>
Gene Marshall and Norm Burns and his spooky singers, working with<br>
words provided by inspired, endlessly hopeful (mostly senior)<br>
citizens who truly believed tunes like &quot;Jimmy Carter Says<br>
&#8216;Yes&#8217;&quot; just needed a little push to make it to the hit parade.<br>
Includes John Trubee&#8217;s &quot;Blind Man&#8217;s Penis,&quot; which is<br>

in the Basement: Joe Bussard&#8217;s Treasure Trove of Vintage 78s 1926-1937</i><br>
CD (Old Hat) A preteen Joe Bussard started knocking on neighbors&#8217;<br>
doors asking if they had any old records they didn&#8217;t want in the<br>
mid-&#8217;40s, expanding his operation to the rural states surrounding<br>
his Maryland home once he learned to drive. Along the way he saved<br>
many a rarity from the dump or careless butterfingers. The result<br>
is a basement stacked floor to ceiling with salvaged shellac relics<br>
documenting the many fascinating, lost strands of American pop<br>
and roots music. The basement&#8217;s a national treasure, and DJ/ raconteur<br>
Joe&#8217;s no slouch himself. This lovingly compiled collection highlights<br>
24 of Joe&#8217;s favorite tracks-jazz, blues, gospel, old timey country<br>
and uncategorizable blends-and there&#8217;s not a dull &#8216;un in the bunch.<br>
Highlights include A.A. Gray &amp; Seven-Foot Dilly&#8217;s infectious<br>
&quot;The Old Ark&#8217;s A&#8217;Moving,&quot; the Dixon Brothers&#8217; gruesome,<br>
matter-of-fact &quot;The School House Fire&quot; and the Corley<br>
Family&#8217;s deliciously amateurish, kiddy-drenched &quot;Give the<br>
World a Smile.&quot; Included in the thick booklet are individual<br>
track notes, handsome sleeve reproductions and transcriptions<br>
of Joe gloating over his most fruitful record raccoon rambles.<br>
If you can&#8217;t pay a visit to Joe&#8217;s basement yourself, this is a<br>
pretty good substitute.</a></p>

<p><b>V/A</b> <i>Inside Deep Note: Music of 1970s Adult Cinema</i><br>
CD (O.S.T. Grammo-fonpladen) Seventy-odd minutes of hack funk-jazz<br>
purportedly from various obscuro &#8217;70s skinflicks (<i>Soul Sisters</i>,<br>
<i>Brighton Beach Bunnies</i>), this collection is more like one<br>
of Big Chief&#8217;s old fake-blaxploitation albums than a legit archival<br>
find. The music is strictly pastiche, but the accompanying booklet<br>
has many pictures of truly stunning nudes, as well as a delightfully<br>
dubious reminisce from a female porn director on her start in<br>
the biz. The package is a welcome trip back to the era of polyester<br>
and the bucket-seat blowjob. &#8217;70s nostalgia is as durable as ever,<br>
probably because people were having a demonstrably better time<br>
of it than in the repressed, glumly politicized present. (Ron<br>

underground, self-released singles, song-poem LPs, etc. Highlights<br>
include contributions from scatman Shooby Taylor, nerdy anger-rocker<br>

to Monte Hellman&#8217;s <i>Two Lane Highway</i>, a project probably<br>
best known &#8217;round these parts for featuring Dennis Wilson&#8217;s sleepy<br>
cinematic debut. Using new and vintage material from folks like<br>
Leadbelly, Cat Power, Wilco and Giant Sand, the compilers create<br>
a rangy, lonesome mood that may well evoke <i>TLB</i> in your<br>

<p><b>Viva L&#8217;American Death Ray Music</b> <i>A New Commotion A<br>
Delicate Tension (And the Exquisite Corpse of Mr. Jimmy) </i>CD<br>
(Misprint) These Memphis cats thrive on change, whether it means<br>
Frenchifying their name, stripping down to a three piece, or alternating<br>
releases on local label Misprint and Sympathy. Here they plug<br>
into a chunky Velvety groove-writing one song called &quot;The<br>
New Age&quot; and adding &quot;Sister Ray&quot; lyrics to another<br>
to make it easy on us scribblers-then introduce all manner of<br>
post-punk twitchery and spaciousness. Sometimes krab-with-a-k<br>

with a <i>Lust for Life</i> rhythm track, Jaggery sneer and loping<br>
erotic energy. They&#8217;re pretty enough to back it up, too. A little<br>
monochromatic, but interesting. Partly produced by Don Was?</p>

The Sound of Hinduism</a></i> CD (Collector&#8217;s Choice) High-minded<br>
1967 disc intended to introduce a Western audience to the themes<br>
and sounds of the Hindu faith, partly narrated by the British<br>
religious scholar, broadcaster and author. The hypnotically simple<br>
tabla and tampura parts are played by one Vincent Delgado, and<br>
when Watts proclaims that &quot;all of us are rays from one center,<br>
tits on one sow, sounds one on flute, forever and ever,&quot;<br>
it seems quite feasible. Damn big sow, though.</p>

and expansive on this follow up to <i>Here Come the Miracles</i>,<br>
again recorded in Tucson with Chris Cacavas guesting on keys.<br>
Wynn &amp; co. are quite adept at playing out haunting grooves,<br>
here seasoned with a nice jolt of silliness, &quot;California<br>
Style.&quot; The longer he lives in NYC, the more it seems L.A.<br>
turns up in his songs. Neat to see the old Down There logo on<br>
the back, vestige of Wynn&#8217;s paisley underground-era label that<br>
issued early Dream Syndicate and Green on Red EPs.</p>

is better known as a record producer and all around hipster, but<br>
he wasn&#8217;t immune to the performance bug. <i>You Goddam Kids!</i><br>
is probably only interesting to music history junkies and those<br>
who didn&#8217;t pick up the record when they were pub-crawling LA circa<br>
1980. It&#8217;s an interesting snippet of a style that&#8217;s almost forgotten,<br>
a new wavey mix of Residents and Broadwayish tunes with keyboards,<br>
marimbas and &quot;Gezatone&quot; guitar. Lots of famous people<br>
involved here like Josie Cotton plus various Germs, Screamers<br>

First Sessions</a></i> CD (Var&egrave;se Sarabande) The apparently<br>
unkillable Zevon has lingered long enough to see a slew of reissues<br>
of his older material, including this comp of solo and Lyme &amp;<br>
Cybelle demos. L&amp;C were a folk-pop duo composed of Zevon and<br>
Violet Santangelo, and their &#8217;66 White Whale single &quot;Follow<br>
Me&quot; (written by the pair) is a neat propulsive jangler that<br>
charted locally. The demos are a weird, mixed bag, with Dylan,<br>
Beatles and Jimmy Reed covers adding little to the source material,<br>
but their own songs having an eerie, romantic ambiance. Zevon&#8217;s<br>
solo juvenilia, recorded with Bones Howe, includes his original<br>
&quot;Outside Chance&quot; with its arrangement almost identical<br>
to the Turtles cover. Nothing great, but fans will be curious<br>
to see him messing with styles on the way to finding a voice of<br>
his own, hinted at with the creepy &quot;A Bullet for Ramona.&quot;<br>
Bonus tracks include the Zevon-less Lyme &amp; Cybelle single<br>
that Curt Boettcher produced, a giddy piece of old timey California<br>
pop.<br>

<p><b>The Zombies</b> <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00008NRLJ/bubblegumbook">Zombies<br>
    featuring She&#8217;s Not There / Tell Her No</a></i> CD (Var&egrave;se Sarabande)<br>
    There&#8217;s scads of Zombies material out there, so why pick up this latest reish?<br>
    For context, that&#8217;s why. This mono mix of the band&#8217;s American debut (plus<br>
    six early domestic singles) serves as a snapshot of the precise schoolboy<br>
    R&amp;B that turned them into stars off their native shores. Only with Chris<br>
    White&#8217;s yearning 1965 b-side &quot;I Love You&quot; is there a hint of the<br>
    baroque A-level pop that would come with the posthumous <i>Odessey &amp; Oracle</i>.<br>
    Call it Zombies Mach I, a fun, somewhat unsung body of work.</p>
