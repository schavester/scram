				<p>The Go-Betweens, interview from Scram #14</p>
<p><em>posted in memory of <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> McLennan, a gentleman and an artist, R.I.P. May 6, 2006</em></p>
<p>Someone played me a Go-Betweens record in 1985, and I just didn&#8217;t get it&#8212;to my eternal regret, because I spent the next year in London, unaware of the wonderful band sharing that city. A decade later loud guitars were less essential to my listening enjoyment, and I realized my mistake. I even named a tabby cat Talullah. But by that time the only way to see the Go-Betweens was in pieces: <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> Forster one year, <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> McLennan the next. Astonishingly talented songwriters, the both of them, but neither one can singly replicate the strange magic when they play together. Happily, they&#8217;ve reunited to record a fine new Go-Betweens disk (The Friends of Rachel Worth), and have been touring with shared longtime bass lass <strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong> Pickvance. <strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong> Griffis and I caught up with them backstage at the Hollywood Knitting Factory during soundcheck for a rambling chat encompassing tailoring, space vampires and the mystery of whether <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> or <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> have ever worked a day in their lives.</p>
<p>-KIM Cooper</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What are your immediate plans?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: We&#8217;re going to San Francisco on Monday, and then fly home Tuesday night.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And where is home?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Brisbane, in Australia. <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> goes back to Germany. And then we reconvene after Christmas, in early January, for rehearsals with our new drummer, for a series of festivals. The Big Day Out in Australia. We haven&#8217;t played in Australia as the Go-Betweens for twelve years. That&#8217;s gonna be fantastic.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: We&#8217;re playing at the same time as Limp Bizkit.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You&#8217;re opposite them?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Yeah, two bands close the show.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: That&#8217;s good, because I can&#8217;t imagine there&#8217;d be anybody who&#8217;d wanna see both.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Exactly, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a cool thing. And PJ Harvey are playing, Placebo, Rammstein, some Australian bands, You Am I, Powderfinger. It should be good.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You were saying you had a drummer and you lost one. How many nights did you do with the drummer?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: It&#8217;s three and a half weeks we&#8217;re on the road. We did <span class="caps">CMJ</span> the 17th or 18th of October, and the last show we did with him was in Barcelona on the 15th of November. So it&#8217;s about a month. And now we have to find a drummer, and it would be good if this person was Australian, as we&#8217;re all gonna be in Australia. We had such a good time with Janet Weiss from Sleater-Kinney and Quasi. She would have been perfect for us.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: She&#8217;s doing something else now?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: She&#8217;s got two bands; she can&#8217;t really spend time with us on the road. We were lucky to get her for the record, really. But she set a standard, cause we know how we can sound with her. And just the personal chemistry: we liked her, very very much.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You&#8217;re gonna have to find someone very special.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Exactly. Without being egotistical, we&#8217;ve got three special people now, we need the fourth one and then we&#8217;re invincible. Isn&#8217;t that true, <strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: It is. Extremely so.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Well, with all three of you looking, you&#8217;re bound to find someone.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I know, I know. But see, this is what we&#8217;re gonna do. We&#8217;re doing the Big Day Out, and that&#8217;s when we&#8217;re gonna get the word out. We&#8217;re travelling with all these bands, and we&#8217;re gonna go to each city. So it&#8217;s the perfect opportunity to just pick peoples&#8217; brains.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Maybe you can put the word out that the best drummer in every town should be ready to play one song with you.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Now that&#8217;s a good idea.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And it can be the last song of the set, so if it&#8217;s awful everyone will be leaving anyway.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Right, but it is putting someone into a high-pressure situation. <br>
(<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> leaves the room.)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Soundcheck might be better.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: No, no, there is no soundcheck.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Not for the big festival. You just get in there and do it.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: The first band of the day does all the soundchecking. (laughter)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: So by the end of the day the microphones are really smelly!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: We were just talking about that. Apparently the American Music Club has a rider that you have to disinfect their microphones for them!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: (through a mouthful of bread and cheese) What I&#8217;ve talked about with <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> is getting a roadie to come out just before we start playing, with a bottle of Chanel No. 5, quite visible to the crowd, and just spray each of the microphones. (giggles) Preferably the grottiest roadie that you can find! <br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: One of the really big bottles, the toilet water.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Will it be Chanel No. 5 or will it be?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I don&#8217;t know. <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>&#8216;s the expert on perfume in the band. Ask him.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What are you the expert on?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I&#8217;m tempted to say everything else-but I won&#8217;t! (laughter) A few things.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: (noticing a club employee with a vat of energy drinks) Oooh, Red Bull! <br>
(<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> disappears with employee)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Wanna do a little interview, <strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Sure.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Tell us about yourself.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Ah, okay. I&#8217;m from Manchester. I lived in Brisbane, and that&#8217;s where I met <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>, as you know. That&#8217;s when I met you, when we were doing the Warm Nights tour. I&#8217;ve played with <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> as well for solo kind of stuff. And then suddenly these guys get together and decide to do an album, and I was lucky enough to be chosen to play bass. And it&#8217;s worked out really well.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Were you surprised that they decided to get back together?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I don&#8217;t know. Every couple of years, they&#8217;d do a little duo tour. And in &#8216;96 we did a Go-Betweens show in Paris for Les Inrockuptibles, a French magazine. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: They used the Go-Betweens name?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Yeah. And I&#8217;ve been involved in those with two different drummers. And also we did a little European tour in &#8216;97. So, it&#8217;s good that they&#8217;ve got an album out-I think it&#8217;s about time! It wasn&#8217;t a surprise, but I was hoping that they would. And it felt like it was gonna happen. I think it&#8217;s perfect timing.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: They both have built up a lot of interest in their individual work, but it&#8217;s sort of like-you have two halves of a deck of cards, and you keep messing them around-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Yeah, this new album, it sounds to me like-it&#8217;s a Go-Betweens&#8217; album, but it&#8217;s <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>&#8216;s and <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>&#8216;s songs. They&#8217;re each playing and each has an influence. It&#8217;s weird, they&#8217;re kind of different but they work together so well. <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>&#8216;ll throw some licks and ideas onto <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>&#8216;s songs and <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> will put ideas onto <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>&#8216;s songs, and I think it ends up sounding really good. I&#8217;m just enjoying the touring. And the Big Day Out will be happening, then maybe another European tour.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What do you do when you&#8217;re not with them?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I play in a band in Australia, in Melbourne, called the Dave Graney Show, which is a guy who used to play in the Moodists. And I have a day job as well, because you know, musician, it&#8217;s impossible.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (whispering) We were wondering-do <span class="caps">THEY</span> have day jobs?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: (whispers back) No! (laughter) They&#8217;re big stars. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: It&#8217;s hard to ask. They&#8217;ve never worked a day in their lives?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I don&#8217;t think so! You can always tell. For me, I always look at their hands. (laughter) All these beautiful soft hands!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Y&#8217;know who else had hands like that was Tiny Tim, because he always put lotion on whenever he had an impure thought.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Oh, really?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And he had very, very soft hands, because he&#8217;d obviously had a lot of impure thoughts. But I don&#8217;t know if he ever worked either. He was kind of crazy.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: He must have worked as a 15-year-old youth somewhere. Paperboy?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve done as much work as anyone, but I&#8217;ve never known them to-they&#8217;ve survived, it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s really hard, this inconsistent kind of-one minute you&#8217;re all right, and the next minute, &#8220;Oh my god!&#8221; <br>
(We stop recording and reconvene over supper)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: How&#8217;s life been in LA?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Oh, LA&#8217;s great. Lots of people are moving here, I think because San Francisco&#8217;s just had all the creativity squeezed out of it by the money people.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Ah, really? That&#8217;s interesting. That&#8217;s a shift.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You haven&#8217;t been up there yet, have you?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: No.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Well, you know what&#8217;s happened, right?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Yeah, the dot-com thing.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And all of the cheap lousy rotten neighborhoods have become unlivable. Landlords have pushed all the poor people out and they&#8217;ve started putting up condos. For a while there were artists doing public street demonstrations against all of the SUVs driving around-but I think people are giving up. All the music venues are shutting . You can&#8217;t even live in Oakland anymore!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: (chortling) All those artists who kicked out the really poor people have gotten kicked out.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I know. When we were up in Portland at the start of this year, I was talking to a lot of people that have come up-like Janet, Sam from Quasi, Larry-they&#8217;d all been in San Francisco for a while, and they&#8217;d all come up to Portland as sort of the next step away. Economically, all of them could survive in Portland and still follow what they were doing, where in San Francisco they&#8217;d have had to make major life decisions that would have cut severely into what they wanted to do. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: People are also moving out to central California, Sacramento, and to Davis-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: And are people going between LA and San Francisco-are people moving to the coast there as well? Or are they going just to LA?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I think there&#8217;s a lot of people in San Francisco who never come to LA-there&#8217;s a big prejudice against it. But there do seem to be people who are coming here from other places.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: One of my friends moved down and has already moved back up! The prejudice is strong. (laughter)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: How&#8217;s Germany?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Good! Very, very nice. But next year I&#8217;ll be moving back with Karen and family, back to Brisbane. At the end of next year. So <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> and I can-a number of reasons-my parents are getting older. And also I want to be in a warmer climate. The German experience is going to go on for about another year. It&#8217;s very good for working, because it&#8217;s a very indoor lifestyle. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Do you live in a city?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: City of about 120,000. It&#8217;s a small, provincial city, but very, very nice. Very beautiful. A classic European city. But it&#8217;s very nice to be out here on the West Coast. I think that we&#8217;re more West Coast people. We&#8217;re a West Coast band.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I think there&#8217;s an affinity between Australia and California-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: There is! As soon as you get here it&#8217;s familiar. Food, culture, everything. It just corresponds a lot more. And also in Australia we get a lot more America, the Californian version, than anything else. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: When you first came to California-when was that?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: God, &#8216;83, &#8216;84.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And was it what you had in your mind, or did you have a California that doesn&#8217;t really exist?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: That was really scary-we did a show, I think-my earliest memory is playing the Lingerie club-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (chuckles) Yeah, on Sunset.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: And there was this guy there who was playing, he&#8217;d written a Top 10 hit, his name was Lee? I think he&#8217;d written one for Blondie-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Yeah, &#8220;Hanging on the Telephone!&#8221; What&#8217;s his name?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: It could have been him or it could have been someone else-I don&#8217;t know if it was actually him-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Was he in the the Nerves?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I dunno, but he was a little bit of a sort of underground singer, and he&#8217;d had a Top 10, and he was kind of hip. He was playing, and he had shoulder-length hair, and this sort of buckskin thing, with all these sort of Valley groupies around! These girls who were like out of a seventies rock fantasy! Hippie girls, with long, long hair-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Jack Lee! Is that it?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: It could have been. But these girls were just sort of not Sunset girls, if you know what I mean, not Rainbow Room girls. These were girls from the Valley that you just imagine sitting around the feet of David Crosby back in 1969! (giggles all around) It was like seeing this rock fantasy that I thought would have been gone, but it wasn&#8217;t, y&#8217;know? <br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: It was a big surprise to you?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Yeah, that this LA rock world still existed. He was just going to get into a big car or some sort of combie-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: A what??<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: A combie, a camper van. And just drive off into the hills, to some sort of &#8220;love pad.&#8221;<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And share the land.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Topanga.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Very Topanga. I thought that era was over, and it wasn&#8217;t. That was my introduction to LA&#8230;. Do you know the Aislers Set? They&#8217;re a San Francisco band.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: No.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: We&#8217;re not allowed to know about them and they&#8217;re not allowed to know about us.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Well, that&#8217;s good.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Tell <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> about the war paintings.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Oh, the war paintings! There&#8217;s this artist Sandow Birk who&#8217;s making war paintings like the ones you see in museums-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Goya and all that-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: But it&#8217;s based on the mythical war of the San Franciscans versus the Angelenos.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Right!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: So you&#8217;ve got all the gay clones coming down fighting the Valley Girls in the trenches of Tarzana!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: This person is from San Francisco?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: He&#8217;s from here but he moved to San Francisco and there felt like he was being attacked constantly for being from Los Angeles.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Every Angeleno who moves up there is shocked to discover that they hate us. And it goes back apparently to the 1970s when they weren&#8217;t allowed to flush their toilets. (laughter) They were told there was a water shortage, and that Southern Californians were using up all their water in their swimming pools. I believe the phrase was &#8220;If it&#8217;s yellow it&#8217;s mellow, if it&#8217;s brown flush it down.&#8221; And they&#8217;re still really angry about that-which I can understand.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I don&#8217;t think anyone remembers that.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Right, right. It&#8217;s over. <br>
(<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> wanders in and demands that we teach him the mellow yellow rhyme, which he repeats delightedly.)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: It&#8217;s a bit like &#8220;the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.&#8221;<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Well, I thought you two might be up on this-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: San Francisco in the &#8216;70s, been through it, mate. They&#8217;re still pissed off about it, eh?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Yeah, they hate people in Southern California-and we don&#8217;t really care about them! Nice place to visit <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>, how has <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> changed since you&#8217;ve known him?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: He&#8217;s sense of humor has improved. It&#8217;s frighteningly quick these days. He&#8217;s more <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> that he&#8217;s ever been, which is a good thing. There was a time when he didn&#8217;t know, and he was sort of that <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> and that <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>, now he&#8217;s <span class="caps">ALL</span> <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Isn&#8217;t that a nice thing to say?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Look, he&#8217;s crying.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: He&#8217;s developed into a very, very fine, world-class rhythm guitarist. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: My guitar playing has improved, hasn&#8217;t it?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Same question for you, about <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> is remarkably the same. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Still 14! (laughter)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: And it&#8217;s on tape!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: (long pause) Very much the same, which is a surprise. But then <strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong> has stayed true to artistic vision, which I think is a remarkable thing. That is a very, very hard thing to do. In other ways remarkably the same, but I think that we are quite similar to the way we were when the band started. And also it&#8217;s not coincidental that the band has re-started. And we&#8217;re still looking for a drummer!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: You can just go out on the street here and find this drummer.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I know, but they&#8217;re sort of-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: We&#8217;re very particular.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What do you need?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Well, you&#8217;ve got to be a Go-Between, whatever that means to you. It means something different to me. It&#8217;s almost impossible to explain. You just know it when you&#8217;re playing with someone that it&#8217;s working. It&#8217;s a groove-and it&#8217;s not just musical groove, it&#8217;s personality groove, and clothes. They can wear really different clothes to the rest of us, but if they&#8217;re cool within that, and they fit-it&#8217;s a matter of fitting. This is a very precious gang. Anyone can join, but you have to fit the criteria. You could be a little bit weird-you know what I&#8217;m saying?-just a little bit weird. But the music shop types don&#8217;t get us. Forget it. No ads in music shops.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Could you guys play &#8220;Stairway to Heaven,&#8221; if you needed to?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: No no no no. We can&#8217;t play any of these songs. Never learned. I can sing it, karaoke style. I can do that.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: That&#8217;s the criteria.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: It might be a 17-year-old who&#8217;s been playing for six months. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: It might be Jet Black.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: We&#8217;re not looking for the product.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Isn&#8217;t that how you started out, just looking for someone who looked like the right drummer?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Exactly!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: So you&#8217;re gonna do it again.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I know, I know. But-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: There&#8217;s only so many Mo Tuckers-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: She&#8217;s around-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: She is, but-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: She&#8217;s Lou&#8217;s drummer.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: But I was saying how much we admire Janet Weiss-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Very much so.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>, where&#8217;d you get your suit?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: This was made in Regensburg. I always thought it very LA. That&#8217;s why I wore it to the soundcheck, because I want to get this suit out and on the street.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: You need the Arthur Lee sort of winklepickers, though.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I know, I know. I think it&#8217;s very Arthur Lee &#8216;66. It&#8217;s very Love.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: It should be a little tighter for the Arthur days.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: I know, but it looks good.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Does it have your name sewn in the pocket?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: No. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: That&#8217;s what you should do. Get a little stitching and put &#8220;<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>&#8220; inside. It&#8217;s a very good idea.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: If it&#8217;s made you have to have your name put in.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: (sounding stricken) I know, but the maker does not want to do any writing on it. I&#8217;ve asked them.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Not their name, not your name?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: No.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: The person that makes them wants to stay anonymous.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: But then fifty years from now when it turns up in a thrift store, someone&#8217;s gonna know it&#8217;s your suit.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: It <span class="caps">WON</span>&#8216;T turn up in a <span class="caps">THRIFT</span> <span class="caps">STORE</span>!! It&#8217;ll be in Cleveland, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In its own little cabinet.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Yeah, it&#8217;s all museum stuff.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Everything you own is going to the museum?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Sure! Of course!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Maybe you can pin it, a little safety pin inside with your name?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: It will be verified.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: You have to learn &#8220;Stairway to Heaven,&#8221; and then you get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Karaoke style. You&#8217;re laughing, but I saw someone do &#8220;Stairway to Heaven&#8221; karaoke style last week. And during the guitar solo he just shook his hair. And it was very wrong.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: This still goes on. This amazes me.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I saw a small girl like you do it on Hallowe&#8217;en in a little fairy outfit. And she did all the live version additions. Like from the movie soundtrack.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: What movie?<br>
<span class="caps">ALL</span>: The Song Remains the Same!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Oh, that&#8217;s a bitchin&#8217; version of it, too. Jimmy&#8217;s got the two guitars-three guitars! Three-necked guitar.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Is this in the fantasy section?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: With the horses.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: No, the fantasy sections are terrible. I saw it recently.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Really?!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: God. I saw it in the West End. It was terrible.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You can&#8217;t watch it in the theater! You have to be able to fast forward.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: The live footage is awesome, the band is just fantastic.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: And what&#8217;s in the fantasy sections? What&#8217;s <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> Plant&#8217;s fantasy?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: On the farm. The hair, the sheepskin vest, the Boticelli little girls running around, and sort of the maid in the field. John Bonham&#8217;s dressed as a gangster. (giggling all around)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Jimmy&#8217;s Satan!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (Laughing) Okay, you guys make the same movie: what are your fantasy sequences? <br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Now that&#8217;s a good idea! <strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>, what would you do? Oh, I know what your fantasy would be; I don&#8217;t have to ask you about that. (chuckling)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I know what you&#8217;re gonna say-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Is it Buffy? (laughter) No, that&#8217;s mine!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: No, no, I can&#8217;t say it! You go first, <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: No. Does your fantasy involve Queen?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: No, it doesn&#8217;t, actually.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I know what <strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>&#8216;s is.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: What is mine?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: To be picked up by the Creature from the Black Lagoon and carried into the swamp!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Mmm, that&#8217;s a good one.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Wow! <br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: All right!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Can I have that one?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Mine&#8217;s some sort of 18th century coffeehouse thing.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: In what country?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: London, of course.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I do like the Viking idea, sitting at a feast at a table, and wine and chicken legs and (makes gnawing sounds). <br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Throwing the bones-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: And huge dogs under the table! And people unconscious, and eating, that&#8217;s my idea.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Maybe they&#8217;re going to burn a ship burial afterwards.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: Yeah, that&#8217;d be nice.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Mine would be a Hawaiian fantasy. Beach house, surf, me running in slow motion-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: In a white linen suit?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Yeah, in a white linen suit down the beach, hair in the wind, very slow motion.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Is there a volcano? (laughter)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: There&#8217;s a volcano with a little bit of smoke. We might do it with animation. <br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Is something chasing you? Women? Lava?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: There&#8217;s a combination of lava and women. There&#8217;s women in lava!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Are they carrying food?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: No, no food, no food, no food!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Fish?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: There&#8217;s no fish! There&#8217;s no food in the fantasy!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: There&#8217;s no coconut-drenched fish in the fantasy?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: There&#8217;s no coconuts, there&#8217;s no fish. There&#8217;s lava, there&#8217;s volcano-I didn&#8217;t know about the women-but there&#8217;s lava coming down the beach. I&#8217;m in the white suit. Bare feet. And I&#8217;m running down the beach, very early in the morning, sunrise, whole screen drenched in orange and red. Waves that nobody&#8217;s riding, and me running down the beach. And then while I&#8217;m coming like this, there&#8217;s a table with a big bowl of muesli! (laughter) Soy milk-<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I told you there was food.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: There&#8217;s always food. Soy milk, strawberries, and a very, very nice muesli. And the New York Times!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Wrapped?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: You&#8217;re good! Wrapped, so I have to unwrap it, sit there on the beach in the white suit, bare feet, eating muesli.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: That&#8217;s great.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: What&#8217;s your fantasy?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: I&#8217;m on the spot, so I&#8217;ll just go to a fantasy I often think about. A spaceship comes down, sort of chrome, and a beam-it&#8217;s the most beautiful light you&#8217;ve ever seen-you get lifted up into the spaceship. And there&#8217;s vampires. And they go, &#8220;Do you wanna come with us?&#8221; And I go, &#8220;You betcha.&#8221; That&#8217;s it.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Isn&#8217;t that a movie already? A space vampire movie?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Do you know the name of it?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Space Vampires?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: It wasn&#8217;t that out of the way. It was pretty popular.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Oh, I&#8217;d love to see that!<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I saw the end of it on the TV with the spaceship and the beam of light coming down.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Proper vampires, not trashy Hollywood vampires.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: You want a sexy vampire.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Like Bela?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: No! None of that rubbish. Your real vampires, people that live forever, those dudes.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What is a real vampire like?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: I haven&#8217;t met one.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Not that you know of.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: You mean somebody that&#8217;s a really together kind of vampire.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Sharp dresser.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Yeah, good clothes. Probably a little bit 18th century.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: A bit foppish.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Yeah, but also a bit of leather. Books, I&#8217;d like there to be books on the spaceship. An opium den. And a bar that serves the best absinthe ever.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: That sounds very nice.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Would you like to come on, then?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: For a short while. (chuckles)<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Have you had absinthe?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: Mmm-hmm.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I had a bottle last Christmas.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Psychedelic or just alcoholic?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I just found it really, really alcoholic.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">GRANT</span></strong>: They&#8217;ve taken the drug out of it now, they&#8217;ve taken the wormwood out.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Really? I thought they were making the real stuff again.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: I got mine over the internet.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: The Czech stuff?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ADELE</span></strong>: It was from London, Canadian from Spain, I think.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: (puzzled) Wormwood?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: It&#8217;s an herb.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: Is it an illegal herb?<br>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Wormwood is perfectly legal. Brewing this alcoholic beverage with wormwood in it has been banned since the early 20th century, because it was causing all sorts of brain disorders in people who were addicted to it.<br>
<strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong>: (hungrily) Ahhh&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>And then the Go-Betweens excuse themselves to get ready to play. <strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong> and I give <strong><span class="caps">ROBERT</span></strong> a ride back to his hotel, commenting on all the rock and roll landmarks along the way; he eats it up. The band later plays a wonderful set with (I think) four encores, and they might have gone on all night if the club hadn&#8217;t rented out the room post-show to an increasingly irritated bunch of salsa dancers. Their annoyed muttering first sounds like tropical birds, then like rude humans. But it can&#8217;t wipe the smiles off <strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>&#8216;s and my face as we take our leave and step out onto Hollywood Boulevard, very happy that the Go-Betweens are back.</em></p>
