		<div class="entry-content">

		
			<p>It&#8217;s entirely too rare that the will to rock and a way with jewel-like melody turns up in a single body. Scram is a proud supporter of such anomalies, and also endorses anyone who wears a rooster haircut at century&#8217;s end. You may know of Kevin Junior&#8217;s work with the Mystery Girls or Rosehips, or backing up Epic Soundtracks towards the end of his life. His Chamber Strings are terrific, brash, tasteful, swaggering, and sweet, and their Gospel Morning record was one of the finest things to come out in the last couple years. Kevin met us before his band&#8217;s Los Angeles debut at Spaceland one summer evening, and impressed us very favorably, because even though he was hallucinating, his manners were pristine.</p>
<p>(as we set up the recorder <strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong> is telling us about how he was abused by the management for smoking at the club the night before)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: So, how was Long Beach, other than that they attacked you?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (chuckling) Terrible! They were just mean to us.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Was it the audience, or the club?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: There was no audience, but if there was maybe they would have been mean, too.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Maybe that&#8217;s why they were mean to you.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah. Well, they were mean before there was any proof of an audience. It was really comical. But the three shows before that were good.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: How long have you been touring?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: We&#8217;ve been to Seattle, Portland and San Francisco.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Well, tonight will be better; this is a good bill.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: There&#8217;ll be people here.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I&#8217;m looking forward to it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Everybody loves the Lazy Cowgirls.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: And you can go in there (gesturing to the space-themed airlock room above the main club) and smoke.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Yeah, you can smoke as much as you want in there, and the smoke just sort of hovers under those&#8230; satellite dishes.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: That&#8217;s real good.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: The smokers&#8217; ghetto.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: So, you ran away to England, huh?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Well, I didn&#8217;t, I just went over there to do some work, basically. I kept coming back. That was where Epic was. When we were first working together there were European tours to be done, and then it became a problem for him to come over here.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Did he have convictions?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: He just never got work permits. He never made any money either, in These Immortal Souls and things&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: But he played shows?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: He just flew into Minneapolis airport and got into a bunch of trouble, &#8216;cause they&#8217;re kind of yokels there. They really don&#8217;t have much else to do.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (in a weak attempt at a Midwestern drawl) &#8216;That guy looks weird, let&#8217;s hassle him.&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: (better, but not by much) &#8216;What are you here for, son?&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, so they completely interrogated him and caused some problems. He was supposed to be allowed to come back a year later, but they kept turning him down for some reason.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: But you didn&#8217;t have any problems going over there?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, no. I like going over there.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: They don&#8217;t pick you out of the crowd and&#8230;?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I got detained once, but&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Where, in London?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Were they mean to you?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: A little. (chuckles)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (hoping for a Midnight Express-type story) What did they do?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Well, they just made me sit there for four or five hours after I&#8217;d been on a plane all night. That&#8217;s pretty mean.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Watching to see what you did. (what he passed, more likely)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: They just didn&#8217;t believe why I was in the country, and once I sorted all that out it was fine.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Did they bring you a cup of tea?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No. But the last time I flew into Berlin, and they didn&#8217;t even ask for my passport!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: In Berlin you&#8217;re normal looking!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: (faux innocent) What trouble could you be up to in Berlin?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Every kind of trouble there is you can get into in Berlin.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I was in a riot in Berlin. I was over there staying with some friends who were squatting in the mid-eighties, and George Bush flew into town that day, so the police decided that there would probably be trouble. So they actually caused a riot: they blocked off this street where all the kids were hanging out anyway and wouldn&#8217;t let anyone leave, and then started beating people up. It was quite a scene. If you stayed inside a cafe you were all right, but if you went outside you were fair game. They were just chasing kids up and down the street.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh my god, how frightening.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Yeah. And after a couple hours my friends and I were bored, so we took our American passports and walked out and said, &#8216;We&#8217;d like to leave, please. We got here by accident.&#8217; And they cross-examined us, they asked us what high schools we went to! Then they let us leave. (chuckles) So, have you been recording with Jim Dickinson yet?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, I wish. We haven&#8217;t actually been contact with him, but that&#8217;s who I want to do the next record. We&#8217;re waiting till we figure out when it&#8217;s gonna be. Then we&#8217;ll get on our hands and knees.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I saw the Memphis plates on your van, so I thought that&#8217;s where you&#8217;d come from.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, just coincidence. We got the van in Chicago.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Maybe it&#8217;s a good omen.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I really wanna do it down there!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Have you been?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Uh-uh. I&#8217;ve always had a fascination with Memphis, but I&#8217;ve never gone. It&#8217;s better, &#8216;cause I want a reason to go down, instead of just as a tourist. I wanna work. I dunno, even if Jim Dickinson doesn&#8217;t do the next record, it&#8217;d be interesting to go down there with somebody else. Like Ron Easley&#8217;s studio or something.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Are the songs written? Your record came out quite a while ago.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Mostly, yeah. The longer I have until it&#8217;s time to record is probably for the best. If I&#8217;ve got twelve songs ready to record and they say &#8216;You can&#8217;t do it for another two months,&#8217; that&#8217;s okay &#8216;cause I might come up with something that&#8217;s better than anything we&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: How many songs do you write in a year?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It depends. The first six months of 1998, I didn&#8217;t write one single song. It&#8217;s the longest stretch of my life, since I became a musician. But it was just &#8216;cause I was going through all kinds of really bad personal stuff, and I couldn&#8217;t muster it up. Once I got past that, it started flowing.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You also had a lot to work with.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, exactly, and it&#8217;s hard to write songs in the middle of all that. When you&#8217;ve got a perspective&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You might not ever want to hear those songs again then! (laughter)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Unless it&#8217;s the blues.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Real deep blues.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: In Memphis that might be good.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (chuckles) Yeah. It&#8217;s like &#8216;60s Memphis soul is really the stuff I&#8217;m most impressed with. I think the next record will incorporate a combination of &#8216;60s soul and Phil Spector, Brill Building pop production and arrangements.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You gonna play with an orchestra?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It&#8217;s definitely gonna be a string-heavy record, I know that, and brass and piano are gonna be on there quite a bit, too. Sorta the way Gospel Morning was, just a wide range of styles. And I&#8217;m just trying with each album to dig deeper into that, just explore as much as I can with all the influences I have. I think it&#8217;s possible to make it sound compatible, too, and not like a different band on every song. So if I&#8217;m trying to get Phil Spector and a Memphis &#8216;60s soul sound, maybe it&#8217;ll end up sounding like Gamble and Huff or something. (chuckles) I dunno, we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Just don&#8217;t be tempted to actually ask Phil Spector to do it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (laughs) We have the same birthday.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Really, when&#8217;s that?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Day after Christmas.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: We just interviewed Johnny Ramone, and he had a few stories to tell, even after all these years.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, I&#8217;ll bet he did!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: The man leaves a lot of stories in his wake.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I mean, if someone said &#8216;Phil Spector&#8217;s producing your album&#8217; I don&#8217;t know how you could possibly turn it down, even though it might ruin your record or ruin your&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Life! He&#8217;s never actually killed anyone as far as I know.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Just kidnapped them.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And put strings on their records that they didn&#8217;t want. But you wouldn&#8217;t mind that. Johnny was really unhappy that there were strings on his record.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, I&#8217;d love that. I might be mad if Johnny Ramone played on my record! (laughs) I love the Ramones, but I just can&#8217;t see a part for Johnny to play on my next record.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Maybe triangle?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, he could do that.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: He doesn&#8217;t wanna play anything anymore, he&#8217;s completely retired. How did you meet Epic and (brother) Nikki (Sudden, of the Jacobites)?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: A mutual friend introduced me to Nikki, and when Epic started coming &#8216;round for his first record we met up. I just introduced myself. I really liked his first solo album, a lot. We got on really well and started hanging out when he&#8217;d come to town. Eventually he called me, when Sleeping Star came out, and said he wanted to have a band play with him, and tour Europe. So we did that and then just kept playing together. It worked out well. And before Epic died I did some stuff with Nikki, on one of his records, and did a few shows here and there. After Epic died we did a couple tours together, and recorded a record called Red Brocade.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Is that a Nikki record, or the Jacobites?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: A Nikki record. It&#8217;s basically the Chamber Strings as his band, but it&#8217;s not really the same record anymore. When he took it back to England he just remixed the whole thing, wiped the drums off half the tracks &#8216; I don&#8217;t give a fuck about it now.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Is it out?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (bored) Mmm-hmm. But, yeah, those days are pretty much over. Me and Nikki still get on, but it just takes too much time away from what I&#8217;m doing, and I&#8217;d just much rather I was concentrating on the Chamber Strings instead of doing someone else&#8217;s thing. But we just did a tour with Nikki in April, May, in Europe for six weeks, so that was a nice way to top it off. I&#8217;d never say never, we might do something again, but I can&#8217;t see it happening for a while.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Do you think if Epic hadn&#8217;t died that you&#8217;d have your own band? Was that something you were working on?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I was working on it in between. My old band had broken up right when I started playing with Epic, and so for the first year I was just writing. Then I started splitting time with the intention that I&#8217;d be able to do this band and play with Epic when he needed me. I figured I&#8217;d just rearrange my schedule for it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: This group was in the states?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah. We would have figured it out somehow.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: We have jet flight now, so you can really do anything you want.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Jet flight &#8216; you can go really fast from place to place.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Really? Oh, I hadn&#8217;t heard of that.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I heard about it on Art Bell.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I bet it costs loads of money, though.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: That&#8217;s true. What&#8217;s your favorite conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (long pause) I don&#8217;t know that many conspiracy theories. I know a lot of myths&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: A myth will do.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Well, I guess the one that just came to mind today was that L.A. is such a horrible place &#8216;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Is that what they told you?!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (laughing) That&#8217;s the myth in Chicago!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And we like Chicago!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I&#8217;ve really enjoyed myself today, so&#8230;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I was real L.A. today: I went to do an interview outside, and we had smoothies (the Scram staff cracks up) on Ventura Blvd.&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You were in the Valley?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, I thought it was &#8216; well, maybe it was.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (as if talking to a child) You were in the Valley.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: And it was just really artificial and&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: It wasn&#8217;t that bad, was it?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, it was great, I loved it! It was like you could breathe out here, &#8216;cause it&#8217;s so humid in Chicago. I was really enjoying just sitting outside and having some ice cream.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And no one pulled a gun on you, did they?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, no one pulled a gun on me, and there was lots of trees and plants around, and it was just very enjoyable, actually.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Well, you can move out here if you want.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah? I just might. I decided when I was in San Francisco a few nights back that I was gonna move there, now I&#8217;ll probably tomorrow think that I&#8217;m gonna move here.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (looking at the tour schedule) You&#8217;re going to Costa Mesa tomorrow &#8216; don&#8217;t be swayed by Costa Mesa!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Oh, that&#8217;s a different world, as different from here as San Francisco is different.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I just wish I could spend more time in these places, but when you&#8217;re on tour you don&#8217;t really get more than twelve hours in a place.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Real snap-shot view.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Some places you don&#8217;t really get to see anything at all, but we got to see a lot of San Francisco.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Where did you play?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: The Cocadrie. And we&#8217;re actually basing ourselves out of here for the next couple of days, so we&#8217;ll get to see more of L.A.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Go to Disneyland.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh yeah! I dunno if I&#8217;ll have time for that. I just saw the Capitol Records building and thought that was so neat. I only ever tour on the east coast and south and midwest, never have made it out here before. We had a tour booked earlier and it got canceled for whatever reason, but it&#8217;s nice to finally get out here.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What&#8217;s one of the most peculiar things to ever happen to you on these tours?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Well, I find it most peculiar that I&#8217;m able to stay awake for three, four days at a time.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Is that normal? Can you do that all the time?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I can&#8217;t do it when I&#8217;m at home. To me that&#8217;s extremely peculiar.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Without taking naps?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Hardly, yeah, just being pretty much up three days straight.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You do three days on and then you crash, as a cycle?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Mmm, and then when I crash it&#8217;s only five hours or something.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (laughing) Your metabolism is really twisted.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: When I come home from tours I&#8217;m always just deathly ill.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: How long have you been awake right now?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: One week.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You&#8217;ve been awake for a week??!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, awake! Away, I thought you meant. We just started this tour a week ago.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: So are you at the end of a cycle right now?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Uhm, yeah, I don&#8217;t even know, I just know that I haven&#8217;t slept, like, properly, in a while. Several days.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Are you hallucinating?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I&#8217;m sort of always hallucinating. (everyone cracks up)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: <strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong> had a lucid dream last night.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: What was that?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I started flying my truck around in the sky.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You wanted to fly, but you were driving, so you both flew!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: (chuckling) An easy way to handle that problem.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I liked what you said about it, &#8216;It had a hundred thousand miles, so it couldn&#8217;t go too high!&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I&#8217;ll have to get the transmission looked at.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Your mechanic&#8217;s not gonna understand.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: &#8216;Cesar? It didn&#8217;t fly high enough.&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Where are you from, originally?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Akron, Ohio. It&#8217;s a strange place to be from.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What&#8217;s it like?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It&#8217;s working class, and it breeds a weird group of people, I think. But we always seems to get good musicians there.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Who&#8217;s from there?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: A lot of diverse people. There&#8217;s bands like the Dead Boys, and then there was the Raspberries&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: They&#8217;re from Akron?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Cleveland. Actually, Akron &#8216; I went to the same high school as Chrissie Hynde and Mark Mothersbaugh and Rachel Sweet.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: (chuckling) At the same time?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (slightly exasperated) No, but they all went to this school.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Is it a normal public school?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah. Aerosmith played there in 1972!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: In the gym?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yes!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What&#8217;s the name of your school?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Firestone.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Firestone!? Like the tire?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, that&#8217;s where they made &#8216;em. Akron was the rubber capital of the world, so that just kinda sets a picture for you.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Maybe all that cookin&#8217; rubber has done something to the gene pool?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, it left something in the air, I think.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Is rubber an artificial product, or is it made out of latex from rubber trees?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (flabbergasted) Wow&#8230;?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You didn&#8217;t learn this is school?!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: It used to be made from trees.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: They used to milk the trees.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I don&#8217;t know where it comes from. I&#8217;m just glad it&#8217;s here!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: When did you leave?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I left when I was about sixteen years old. Came to Chicago. And about a year later started a band, called the Mystery Girls, that sounded like T. Rex and the Flamin&#8217; Groovies. And we couldn&#8217;t play.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: When was this?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: About 1987. We were just such outcasts at the time, &#8216;cause everyone was either in a punk rock band or a heavy metal band. What we were doing was actually really different.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Antagonistic, I would think.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Did you look glammy too?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Did you get beat up?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Uh, we didn&#8217;t! People basically either loved or hated us.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: They guarded you.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah. There were plenty of people who thought we were pretty brave and liked it, and other people didn&#8217;t get it at all. But you know, anytime Johnny Thunders came to town, guess who go the opening slot?! (laughs)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: How many times did you open for him?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, just once, but if he&#8217;d lived I&#8217;m sure we would have gotten it the second time around too! (laughter)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Did he actually play the show?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, he did.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I think it was about one out of three towards the end.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: That was a good experience, because we were all really young, and we couldn&#8217;t play our instruments that well. We were just learning how to write songs.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Who were the big bands in Chicago at that time?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: At that time there weren&#8217;t that many at all. Hardly anybody had record deals. I think Material Issue and&#8230; boy, they were one of the only ones. The big bands were 11th Dream Day and Friends of Betty, who became Red Red Meat. Just any band that could get a record out, even if it was on an indie label, was considered a big band in Chicago! Like, us and Smashing Pumpkins were playing the same clubs to nobody. One day it all changed, but Chicago had really nothing to offer for a long time.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What was it that drew you to Chicago? Just the nearest big city?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, basically. I just wanted more culture in my life, and I knew I wasn&#8217;t gonna be able to get that living in Akron, Ohio.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You must&#8217;ve realized that from an early age.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, I did. The kids I went to school with, I couldn&#8217;t get any of &#8216;em into new wave or punk rock or anything. You couldn&#8217;t even get &#8216;em to listen to an unpopular Stones record! (laughter) They would never put on Goat&#8217;s Head Soup or something.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You must&#8217;ve been really lonely.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, that&#8217;s the whole thing, I just couldn&#8217;t relate to any of my friends there. And there were very few open-minded people. It&#8217;s still that way in Akron. Little groups of outcasts there.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I guess that you appreciate each other much more when there&#8217;s only three people that know what you&#8217;re talking about?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: A secret gang.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Well, I grew up in Hollywood, and I had a hard time relating to anyone, too. I think it&#8217;s like that anywhere.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Grass is always greener.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Oh, I didn&#8217;t think there was anywhere better! High school sucked.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Oh, that must have been really depressing!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Yeah, I was in the pop culture capital of the world and I couldn&#8217;t relate to anyone!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: At least when I was growing up I thought perhaps somewhere else was better.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: She grew up in Miami, so&#8230; we represent the gamut of America here.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, we do.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And we all turned out all right.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: We should become president.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: All three of us?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What was that Roman &#8216; triumvirate, yeah. Okay, I&#8217;m in. (laughter) So after the Mystery Girls then you were with the Rosehips, right?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, that was an advancement for sure, &#8216;cause I was really starting to want to be a songwriter foremost. Before, all I wanted to be was a guitar player. And I was forced into singing because the singer in the Mystery Girls quit after a few shows. But by the time the Rosehips came along I was really into songwriting and crafting and arranging things, not just going in with a four-piece band, bashing it out and mixing it in an hour.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You changed the name &#8216;cause you felt like it was a misrepresentation?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, we just wanted to start fresh and leave all that behind, instead of breaking up and starting a new band to do that.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: It was all the same people?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Mmm-hmm. That was really good for me, and I like the Rosehips&#8217; record. But it did its time, &#8216;cause we had been together for so long before that that we were all just frustrated. And I was starting to talk about Brian Wilson and all these other kinda different things that we&#8217;d never really incorporated in our music, and I think everyone was just kinda like, &#8216;What?!&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Back in Akron again.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: &#8216;Not Rod Stewart? Not Steve Marriott?&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: &#8216;Why would we wanna do that? No, that&#8217;s not right!&#8217; (laughter)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: The main influences for the Rosehips, we were really into the Stones and Faces and Humble Pie, Bob Dylan and the Only Ones, Ike and Tina Turner.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Those are great influences, but it&#8217;s kinda one-sided. It&#8217;s really aggressive.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: That&#8217;s what I said. I&#8217;ve got so many other things in me. That&#8217;s not even one quarter of my record collection at home. I just knew if I got away from them I could do what I wanted and not have to answer to anybody. I could just play it myself if I had to.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Was it hard to make that break after such a long time?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It really wasn&#8217;t at all. It was just like a huge weight off my shoulders, and I was happy to do it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: And they were probably happy not to be hassled about Brian Wilson anymore.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah (chuckling), maybe!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Are they still playing Faces music, or what?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, actually. Two of the guys aren&#8217;t really playing at all, and the drummer&#8217;s playing in Cash Money, which is a Blues Explosion sort of band. (as if on cue, thunderous drumming erupts from Spaceland&#8217;s tiny stage, as the Flesheaters&#8217; drummer embarks on a ridiculously &#8216;professional&#8217; soundcheck.) Uh-oh!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (Explaining for the out-of-towner) Hey, that&#8217;s Chris D., L.A. punk rock royalty. You know I heard he was fired from being a substitute teacher for being too cruel? (<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong> cracks up)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: But now I can say to somebody in the band, &#8216;Do you know this arrangement on this Dionne Warwick song?&#8217; and nobody blinks an eye. It&#8217;s not kitschy&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You can translate what you&#8217;re hearing</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: &#8216;to them and it&#8217;s not out of reach. So that&#8217;s what I want.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I love the record, by the way.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: We do very few interviews, so you should feel flattered! Mostly we do historical stuff.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, I do! I could tell from looking at the bands on the cover, it looks like you have really good taste in what you do. (Scram blushes) I wouldn&#8217;t interview very many new bands either. I wouldn&#8217;t know who to interview.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Would you like to give any fashion or etiquette advice to our readers?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (usually this question stymies people, but <strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong> pipes up without pausing to think) Yes! If you&#8217;re in a band, don&#8217;t wear shorts onstage (laughter)&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What about hot pants, are those okay?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, sure, you can wear hot pants, I suppose. Don&#8217;t wear baseball caps onstage&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Or anywhere.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah. (beginning to sound immensely jaded, so you just know he&#8217;s had to chastise bandmates for all of these sartorial offenses) Don&#8217;t wear a shirt with your own band&#8217;s name on it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Onstage or at all?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: At all!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: That&#8217;s pretty bad. Okay, but what about if your band&#8217;s broken up and it&#8217;s your old band?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Maybe, it depends.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: After five years or so.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: We&#8217;ve got these t-shirts now, I&#8217;m so tempted to put one on, but&#8230;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You can wear it inside out!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: What if you&#8217;re being &#8216;ironic&#8217;?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Ironic&#8217;s bad.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: It&#8217;s bad?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Real bad.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It&#8217;s hard to see irony. But that would be probably the most ridiculous thing I could do, to wear one of the shirts with a picture of me!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: That&#8217;s a nice shirt you have on (a tapered Western number in red and black); where did you get that?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, thanks. I think I just got it at a vintage store.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Unfortunately Nudies&#8217; is closed now so you can&#8217;t go there.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, I know. Actually I asked somebody right before I came out, being a big Gram Parsons fan, I thought maybe Nudies&#8217; &#8216; I knew he died, but&#8230;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: The wife kept it open for a couple years, but they didn&#8217;t seem to be adding to the stock, it was just getting sort of thin toward the end. And it smelled really bad in there! It smelled like some kind of cleaning solution.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: But they did have the pictures on the wall.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I never found the Burritos&#8217; picture though; I looked.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I did!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Did you?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I think it was low, and on the&#8230;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I was in there with my mom, and she wasn&#8217;t that into it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Have you seen the new Gram tribute record?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Seen it but haven&#8217;t heard it &#8216; how is it?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Well, it&#8217;s not very good. But there&#8217;s a couple pictures I&#8217;d never seen inside with him and Nudie. One of them they&#8217;re sitting on his car, and the other it looks like they&#8217;re inside the shop.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Is he wearing the (notorious marijuana-leaf) suit?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah! It&#8217;s not that suit, it&#8217;s a different suit.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Wonder whatever happened to those suits?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: They&#8217;ve got pieces of it, on the cover. They thank someone for letting them use it. I dunno who. (the drumming gets obtrusive again, and we briefly pause the tape)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: &#8216; damn, that&#8217;s loud!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: That&#8217;s really loud!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: <strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>, how do you get your hair to do that? (referring to his Keith &#8216;do)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Just get it cut a certain way. I don&#8217;t have to do anything else.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You don&#8217;t put anything in it?!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, just take a hairdryer&#8217;</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Dry it upside down.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Can I touch it? (does, to much giggling)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It&#8217;s too long, though. (more drums!)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: (groans)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (whispering) Stop it!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: It&#8217;s not a stadium. What&#8217;s the worst band you&#8217;ve ever played with?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: God, two nights ago, I think.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: That&#8217;s just fresh in your mind. It can&#8217;t be the worst ever.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No really, it might have been this band. They&#8217;re called Vain. They opened up for us in San Francisco, a horrible heavy metal band. Two nights before that some horrible hippie band, a kind of Grateful Dead band. Oh god, I&#8217;ve played with some bad bands before!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: So, we got your fashion tips; do you have any etiquette advice?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, I think you should definitely try to be less American at restaurants and follow some tips from the Europeans. Just have a more pleasurable dining experience.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You mean sit there for a very long time without anxiously departing?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Well, everyone&#8217;s just so quick to do things here. They want to get it all done and over with, and I think that it&#8217;s so much nicer to spend some time having a meal, and have red wine with it, make it sort of an event. In America, people just don&#8217;t care. They eat &#8216;cause they have to!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You think they should take more pleasure in the small pleasures.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yes! And I think that men should stop being rude to women.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: You think they&#8217;re less rude in Europe?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, I don&#8217;t know about that! Just in general. I&#8217;ve just been hanging out with some people lately who are extremely rude.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You&#8217;re just living with guys, right?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: How many of you are there on the tour?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: There&#8217;s five of us.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: That must be a real scene.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It&#8217;s okay. They&#8217;re a good bunch of guys. They&#8217;re not too rude.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: So that&#8217;s not who you were talking about, your bandmates?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (laughing) Oh, no! For goodness sake!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Here in L.A.?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (laughing) Who are you staying with?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I&#8217;m staying with a really good friend, but some of his friends are completely pigs, y&#8217;know!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Do they wear shorts and baseball caps?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No. I like &#8216;em, but they&#8217;re completely rude. It&#8217;s appalling for me to hear women referred to as certain names, y&#8217;know?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: What are those names?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: It&#8217;s not good etiquette!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Perhaps you could tell us what names not to call women by?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Um, don&#8217;t refer to them in body parts, I think that&#8217;s not really nice.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Is it okay for us to refer to other women like that?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s all right. It&#8217;s crass.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I dunno. Guys think &#8216; when some people just assume that just &#8216;cause they&#8217;re a fucking fat pig that you are too! They assume that you wanna sit around and hear this kinda stuff come out of their mouths!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Well you have to speak up.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I just prefer to ignore it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Then you&#8217;d be the target of their wrath.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: They&#8217;d call you a girlie man.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Right.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: But the girls&#8217;ll like you.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: So those are my etiquette tips. Quit being rude and enjoy your food.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: What kind of food do you like?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I like things that have been cooked by a person, basically. I&#8217;m just so sick of fast food. Thai food&#8217;s really good.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Have you had any good Mexican food since you&#8217;ve been in the Southland?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, we haven&#8217;t &#8216; yeah! we had Del Taco! (hysterics)</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: No no no no no no no &#8216; you have to have proper Mexican food!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Oh, I live in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood, so I haven&#8217;t been craving it.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: They have very good Mexican food in Chicago.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, they do, especially where I live.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: They don&#8217;t even speak English.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, a lot of &#8216;em don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: When did they come into Illinois?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I dunno. I think Chicago&#8217;s always had a heavy Hispanic population.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I know they&#8217;re in Detroit too. ? and the Mysterians are Mexican guys.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: I always wondered how they got up there.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: I think they started picking, seasonal fruit picking. <strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>, I think we&#8217;ve bothered you enough, perhaps. Is there anything you&#8217;d like to make known to the world?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Something you&#8217;ve wanted to tell all those people?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (nervously) Which people?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Them!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I hate you! Get out of my way! Please leave me alone!! (laughter) Oh, I dunno, I&#8217;ve got lots of philosophies, but it&#8217;s just, I&#8217;m bad under pressure.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Do you have a favorite joke?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: At the moment I have a couple, but they are so rude that I am not gonna repeat them and have &#8216;em in print! I&#8217;m not gonna have that live with me the rest of my life. Let me think of an innocent one.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You&#8217;d rather be remembered as being nicer than you actually are.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, I would actually. Oh, they&#8217;re all so rude! I like rude jokes that are so over-the-top rude, they&#8217;re just so offensive, but people who say that stuff&#8217; (a visit from a little tour fairy interrupts) What&#8217;s this?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span>*/*<span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: Drink tickets!!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: (suddenly distracted) I&#8217;ll tell you later, when the tape&#8217;s not on.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: You&#8217;ve got drink tickets, there&#8217;s no point in going on.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: Yeah, maybe I will start drinking now. I&#8217;ve felt miserable all day. I drank about a gallon of red wine last night.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: Oh! Did it come out of a box or out of a bottle?</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: No, out of a bottle. It was a good bottle of wine, but, yeah&#8230; I&#8217;m just irresponsible.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: No you&#8217;re not; you&#8217;re on tour.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I take that excuse too much. (weflip the tape as <strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong> is saying something about staying with people while on tour) I don&#8217;t care if you have to go to work tomorrow! Stay up with me! I&#8217;m not tired!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">MARGARET</span></strong>: You&#8217;re a mischief-maker.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: I guess so. I&#8217;ve got a big devil here (points to one shoulder, then the other), and one right over here.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: (laughing) Two devils? C&#8217;mon! He doesn&#8217;t have any competition!</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KEVIN</span></strong>: But they&#8217;re both really nice guys.</p>
<p>
<strong><span class="caps">KIM</span></strong>: They&#8217;d like to be remembered as being nicer than they are.</p>
