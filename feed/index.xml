<p>Monkeyin&#8217; around on the set of The Chimp Channel<br />
with Becky Ebenkamp<br />
(from Scram #12)</p>
<p>Thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a fine line between the sublime and the stupid, but only occasionally does there come along an entertainment vehicle brilliant enough to straddle it.  For every Cabin Boy thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 1,347 Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolos.  But one lowbrow equation is a proven theorem: Monkeys = funny.</p>
<p>Having long considered Lancelot Link Secret Chimp the peak of quality television entertainment, I was justifiably giddy to learn that TBS would be producing a half-hour weekly series called The Chimp Channel.  Since the â€œsitâ€ in this â€œcomâ€ would revolve around apes running a TV station, viewers would get both a window on backstage showbiz hijinks and a satire of boob tube offerings.  Like SCTV, only simian.</p>
<p>Co-creator Tom Stern, a writer with a specialty in chimp-specific work, helped popularize the primate parody concept for a series of 1998 promos for TBSâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s stable of classic films.  In â€œMonkey-ed Movies,â€ apes re-enacted scenes that ran the gamut from Gone With the Wind to Saturday Night Fever to Braveheart.   The interstitials proved so popularâ€”America, after all, loves a monkey and a clothed chimp all the more soâ€”that TBS subsequently aired an all-Oscar revue.  TCC was green-lighted on the strength and ratings of these shorts.  </p>
<p>But soon after production began, Stern found himself at odds with TBS suits regarding the direction of TCC.  The fuse blew on the set, when a blotto Stern reportedly flipped out, stripped nude and antagonized the stationâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s top brass.  In his version, this was not a drunken display but â€œperformance artâ€ to protest creative differences.  Whatever it was, Stern was canned, lawsuits followed and The Chimp Channel went on without its prime visionary at the helm.</p>
<p>A few months into its run, I managed to procure a visit to the TCC set.  While thrilled at the prospect, I didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t realize what a coup it was.  Even a fly buzzing by, I was told, could be a major scene-wrecker for a curious chimp thespian, so this was a closed set.  Because of the apesâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> limited working hours and desire to interact, I was briefed on â€œtabooâ€ behavior such as touching or feeding them, making gestures or even eye contact.  However, none of this advice proved necessary, as the simians hardly co-mingled with crew members, let alone me.  </p>
<p>While getting a tour through the scaled-down-to-monkey-size setâ€”walking through it was a bit like visiting Being John Malkovichâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s 7 and 1/2th floorâ€”an announcement rang though the unassuming warehouse buried in the Burbank foothills.  â€œAttention: Chimps are entering the building!  Everyone take your place!â€  Five minutes later this was followed by â€œChimps are now walking through!â€  Only the trainer and cameraman were allowed in the actual performing area, it seemed.  Those not essential to the up-close action, including the director, viewed from monitors 50 feet away.  </p>
<p>In the scene being filmed, the showâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s female leadâ€”a Pamela Anderson actress-type named Marinaâ€”would hysterically wave a gun at TCCâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s general manager.  But before she could fire, another chimp was to emerge from a door that would open to knock the gun out of her hand.  This 15-second scene was rehearsed several times with a trainer, as it required the female chimp to react to the doorâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s bump and toss the gun as if it were accidentally flying out of her hand.  To ensure that her mouthing matched up to the cadence of the dialogue, the trainer â€œhand-talkedâ€ to a recorded tape and the primate aped.</p>
<p>This is a lot to remember, especially when one is wearing an uncomfortably hot wig and itchy, ill-fitting dress.  Many times, the scene wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t performed to completion because the actress tugged her hair off or chewed the weapon.  In order not to expend any additional monkey energy, the role of opening the door was relegated to a human during the lengthy rehearsal.  The chatter, bump!, toss the gun sequence was repeated ad infinitum.    </p>
<p>Finally, it became time to film, and the chimp was placed behind the door.  Everything was going well: the actress mouthed her dialogue and held the gun at the proper angle.  Then, right on cue, the other chimp bumped her with the door, but she detected a subtle difference.  The Pamela Anderson chimp flipped around, saw that the culprit was another monkey, interpreted his action as an attack and clocked him over the head with her gun.  Much shrieking ensued.  I saw the director glance down from his monitor and rub his temples in a â€œhow the hell did I get into this racket?â€ motion.  </p>
<p>I have no idea whether this was the last straw, but a few weeks later TBS announced it was ceasing production on The Chimp Channel.  I donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know if the episode I watched was the last to be taped; it was the last to air.  </p>
<p>It wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t like TCC was the funniest thing to hit the airwaves, but its presence is sadly missed in a TV environment sorely lacking in chimp antics.  Perhaps some brave, bright soul will pick up the gauntlet.  Until then, at least we have MoJo JoJo.â€¢</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey, puffball!&nbsp; Become a badass instantly using my Dynamic Tension Method.</p>
<p>For the four skins this magazine set you back, gentle reader, you are getting a bargain.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve boiled away the unsightly fat of self-help to reveal the true secret of badassery.&nbsp; Yeah, that&#8217;s right, you ain&rsquo;t no badass, you&#8217;re a big fat square. Getting caught reading this is like your mom walking in when you&rsquo;re reading porn, it&#8217;s an admission that you just ain&rsquo;t boss, try though you may.&nbsp; I know the sweat is beading up on the back of your neck now, but that&#8217;s okay, because if unwanted moisture is your problem we can take care of that, too.&nbsp; After many long years (read: about twenty minutes) of careful study I&#8217;ve developed the Dynamic Tension Method to achieving a badder-ass you. Using my four pronged attack you can finally shake those loser blues and cross the city limits into Coolsville.</p>
<p>I used to be a 98 pound weakling.&nbsp; I&#8217;d go to the beach and bullies kicked sand in my face.&nbsp; Actually I&#8217;m a 140 pound weakling &#8212; well, I am 6&#8242; 1&quot; &#8212; and I hate the beach, but the point is the same: I wasn&#8217;t with it, and everyone could tell.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d tried other approaches to winning the envy of my peers with no success.&nbsp; Charles Atlas, the great comic book fitness hustler, once separated me from a pocketful of cash with the promise of his Dynamic Tension Method, which turned out to just be doing push ups with your hands on chairs and your feet on the ground. It might&#8217;ve worked, except I disliked exercise more than I disliked being a wimp.&nbsp; My Dynamic Tension works much better than his, and you don&#8217;t even have to break a sweat.</p>
<p>The real breakthrough came when I decided to start emulating a tough guy icon.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; one of the best ways to be a big dork is to model yourself after someone who&rsquo;s badass in the wrong way.&nbsp; Greasing your hair and sneering when you talk an Elvis does not make.&nbsp; Critical to my success was the choice of a proper role model.&nbsp; After sampling and discarding a string of rock stars and pro-wrestlers, I settled upon the oft-overlooked Pee-Wee Herman.&nbsp; My approach was simple: whenever I felt awkward, I tried to do what Pee-Wee would do.&nbsp; If someone scared me I would yell and run away in as comic a fashion as possible.&nbsp; If someone glared at me I would make faces at them.&nbsp; And if someone said the secret word I would scream real loud!&nbsp; To be honest, I had mixed results at first.&nbsp; People did look at me like I was crazy, but it was sort of fun. Eventually this technique led me to the zenith of badass that I am today. [*Footnote: Am I actually a zenith of badass? If you don&#8217;t think so tell me about it and I&#8217;ll stick a fork in your eye. How&#8217;s that sound, bitch?]</p>
<p>Through a lengthy process of trial and error I reduced my apparent mania to its four fundamental elements, which have become the four prongs my attack, the Dynamic Tension Method.&nbsp; Think of it as a fork of tuff, the holy trinity plus one.&nbsp; By following these guidelines, you will be able to overcome your life of shame and degradation and walk proudly among the hipster elite.&nbsp; If it doesn&#8217;t work ask your magazine retailer for your money back and tell them what a loser you are, unable to even follow these simple instructions.</p>
<p>1. Get a mantra. A silent repetitive chant can help you through any crisis.&nbsp; The reason people find them so frustrating (and so often abandon them) is because they choose the wrong ones.&nbsp; You may have had someone recommend a mantra to you before, and it was probably along the lines of Om, hare krishna or some such nonsense.&nbsp; No wonder people lose patience &#8212; what the hell does hare krishna mean?&nbsp; Dynamic Tension recommends something that includes the word fuck, such as I-swear-to-god-if-you-don&#8217;t-stop-bothering-me-I&#8217;m-going-to-stick-a-fucking-ice-pick-through-your-skull.&nbsp; While saying that out loud to someone might give them a good reason to shoot you, repeating it to yourself when faced with adversity will send out psychic rays that will deter any foe!&nbsp; Try it the next time you have to talk to someone you don&#8217;t like. Once you have this tool under your belt you should never have to be under anyone&#8217;s thumb again, and that&#8217;s half of being a badass right there.</p>
<p>2. You&rsquo;re tough now, kid, so start acting like it.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re new to the game try doing things that will remind you how tuff you are.&nbsp; Take off your shoes and draw cat faces on the ends of your socks in magic marker. Whenever you feel stupid just remember &quot;Hey! I&#8217;m a badass, there&#8217;s cats on my socks, they&#8217;ll take care of me!&quot;, and perk up.&nbsp; Anything you can do that reminds you of how tough you are when faced with social inadequacies is worth trying.&nbsp; Remember: when you&rsquo;re a drip being idiosyncratic is bad, but when you&rsquo;re a badass your eccentricities are, well, cool.</p>
<p>3. Know when you&rsquo;re beat and respond with a non sequitur.&nbsp; In a perfect world, everything a badass person did would be cool.&nbsp; In the real world everybody does stupid things sometimes, and pretending like you&rsquo;re always right only makes you look like a jerk.&nbsp; [*like this article!]&nbsp; If you get caught doing something dumb the only way to save face is to respond with a completely random action so stunning it takes the shame away from your gaffe.&nbsp; Girlfriend catches you drinking milk from the bottle? Bark like a dog!&nbsp; Boss asks why in the security video it looks like you&rsquo;re stealing office supplies?&nbsp; Start channeling dead silent-movie stars!&nbsp; I.R.S. wants to know why you haven&#8217;t filed your taxes in three years?&nbsp; Pretend to have a seizure!&nbsp; There are a thousand possibilities for every awkward situation, but I think you get the idea.</p>
<p>4. Don&#8217;t forget to be nice.&nbsp; Being a badass and not being nice makes you a much bigger asshole than being not a badass and not being nice.&nbsp; Smile at waitresses.&nbsp; Feed stray kittens.&nbsp; Hold a door open for someone.&nbsp; Keep in mind, being nice isn&#8217;t the same as letting yourself get pushed around, and finding the fine line between the two takes a little trying, but you can do it!&nbsp; As a last piece of advice I recommend that if you ever feel like you&rsquo;re losing patience with being nice you take a long, leisurely nap.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t feel bad about it, I take lots of naps, and look at me.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s the crux of the biscuit there.&nbsp; The rest is up to you.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t you feel more like a badass already?</p>

<p>I read on my editor David Barker&#8217;s 33 1/3 <a href="http://33third.blogspot.com/2006/08/updated-sales-chart.html" target="_blank">blog</a> this morning that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/082641690X/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank">Neutral Milk Hotel book</a> is the fastest pony in the paddock. One doesn&#8217;t like to brag about book sales, but you gotta understand, all my previous publications have been so proudly under the radar that it&#8217;s just a hoot to see something I&#8217;ve written be so popular. But there are plenty of great books on that list&#8211;collect &#8217;em all! </p>
<p>David says:</p>
<p>Not too much movement on the chart over the last couple of months &#8211; most of the books are still selling, but at a very similar rate. Notable exceptions being the <em>Forever Changes</em> book in the UK, on the back of Arthur Lee&#8217;s sad death, the DJ Shadow book, those on the Pixies and Beastie Boys, and of course the Neutral Milk Hotel book, which keeps going, week after week.</p>
<p>(Note to self: no more books about bands with &quot;Stone&quot; in their name&#8230;)</p>
<p>1. The Smiths<br />2. The Kinks<br />3. Pink Floyd<br />4. Joy Division<br />5. Neutral Milk Hotel<br />6. Velvet Underground<br />7. The Beatles<br />8. Radiohead<br />9. Love<br />10. Neil Young<br />11. Rolling Stones<br />12. Dusty Springfield<br />13. Beach Boys<br />14. DJ Shadow<br />15. Jimi Hendrix<br />16. The Band<br />17. The Replacements<br />18. Led Zeppelin<br />19.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liz Damon&#8217;s Orient Express: 1900 Yesterday<br />

</p>
<p>When I lived in Portland a few years ago, I got in the habit of tuning in the local &#8220;Mature Adult Contemporary&#8221; station, Sunny 910. The geriatric AM frequency spun &#8220;original hits of the &#8217;40s, &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s,&#8221; and, though their slogan didn&#8217;t mention it, the &#8217;70s too. Mixed in among the easy-listening powerhouses (Sinatra, Como, Mathis) and the stinkers (Reddy, Lightfoot, Newton-John), were a few swell acts that were new to me (Brubeck, Denny, Getz).</p>
<p>Once every few months this one particularly amazing song that I&#8217;d never heard elsewhere would come on, usually in the middle of the night. I was instantly grabbed by its spine-tingling, ethereal female vocals, singing an infectious, broken-hearted melody about lost love, along with this cryptic chorus:</p>
<p>Like smoke from a cigarette<br />
Dreams that you soon forget<br />
It&#8217;s fading away<br />
And it&#8217;s 1900 yesterday</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that all about? After I caught the tune for maybe just the third time in a year, I typed &#8220;1900 Yesterday&#8221; into a search engine and, sure enough, discovered it to be the title of the song, performed by an outfit called Liz Damon&#8217;s Orient Express. The group&#8217;s debut single, written by some guy named John Cameron, peaked at #33 on the Billboard charts in February 1971 I found a copy of the single in December 1998 and played it over and over across the following year. While its B-side, &#8220;You&#8217;re Falling in Love,&#8221; wasn&#8217;t worth a second listen, the A-side haunted me, fueling my pre-millennium tension (which I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit, but the media&#8217;s Y2K doomsday hype did have me a little spooked). Still, I couldn&#8217;t resist repeated listenings, wondering if, way back when, Liz Damon and company were onto something.</p>
<p>Namely, was &#8220;1900 Yesterday&#8221; some kind of premonition about digital clocks unable to recognize 01/01/00 at the stroke of midnight on New Year&#8217;s Eve? Would computers really roll back a full century, causing global blackouts, planes dropping from the sky, the accidental launch of nuclear warheads and scores of other catastrophes? More than Prince&#8217;s &#8220;1999&#8221; or that Jennifer Lopez video or any of the other stupid millennium-themed tunes by Sting or Will Smith, I&#8217;ll forever associate the turn of the century with this weird song.</p>
<p>Of course, the new century arrived, the world didn&#8217;t end, and things for the most part were fine. And I set out to find more music by the Orient Express. However, it became quickly apparent that the sublime &#8220;1900&#8221; isn&#8217;t representative of group&#8217;s overall sound, which isn&#8217;t even half as breathtaking.</p>
<p>They had a late-&#8217;60s/ early-&#8217;70s boy-girl pop-vocal vibe, calling to mind Spanky &amp; Our Gang. The combo&#8217;s pleasant, breezy tunes were often punctuated with a lively horns and a bit of the period&#8217;s light exotica, Ã  la the Sandpipers or Sergio Mendes and Brasil &#8217;66. Though the band hailed from Hawaii, their music was more suited for a cocktail lounge than a luau. A xylophone added a vaguely tropical air to some cuts, but there were no discernable ukuleles or slack-key guitars.</p>
<p>Still, based of the strength of their smashing debut single, a brief overview of the rest of their recorded output is in order. Here &#8217;tis:</p>
<p>Â· At the Garden Bar, Hilton Hawaiian Village LP (Makaha Records, 1970)</p>
<p>The Orient Express began its performing career with a year-and-a-half-long gig as the house band of the Garden Bar, a lounge at Waikiki&#8217;s Hilton Hawaiian Village (the beachfront high-rise hotel with the big rainbow painted on its side).</p>
<p>Despite the debut album&#8217;s title, which suggests a live disc, ATGB was laid down at Annex Studio in Los Angeles and Commercial Recording in Honolulu. Makaha Records released it, but White Whale soon picked it up and reissued it simply as Liz Damon&#8217;s Orient Express. They released the opening track, &#8220;1900,&#8221; as its lead single.</p>
<p>The group recorded no original material and instead covered contemporary hits and standards with their own unique arrangements, in this case the Beatles&#8217; &#8220;Something&#8221; and &#8220;Let It Be,&#8221; the Carpenters&#8217; &#8220;Close to You&#8221; and Ray Stevens&#8217; unfunny &#8220;Everything is Beautiful.&#8221; Other than &#8220;1900,&#8221; the best moment in the band&#8217;s catalogue is the arching chorus of the follow-up single, &#8220;But for Love.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gatefold sleeve opens to reveal cutouts of the nine group members&#8217; heads, and high praise by the entertainment editor of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. The back cover features a long shot of the Orient Express in action at the Garden Bar, all in matching costumes. Liz Damon is front and center, flanked by her backup singers/ dancers: to her left is her sister Edda Damon, and on her right is Sydette Sakauye. Behind them is a six-man band; judging from their appearances, the name &#8220;Orient Express&#8221; apparently referred to their Asian roots.</p>
<p>Â· Try a Little Tenderness LP (Delilah Records, 1970)</p>
<p>Their second album includes the title track, Laura Nyro&#8217;s &#8220;Time and Love&#8221; and a take on &#8220;Love Story.&#8221; Anthem Records reissued the disc as Volume II and released two singles: the Burt Bacharach-Hal David tune &#8220;Loneliness Remembers&#8221; b/w &#8220;The Quiet Sound,&#8221; and Paul Williams&#8217; &#8220;All In All&#8221; b/w Bacharach-David&#8217;s &#8220;Walking Backwards Down The Road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthem&#8217;s release also had different cover art, replacing the cool line drawings of Liz with an extreme close-up of a pair of airbrushed eyes (presumably hers). The cardboard cover itself had a slightly corrugated texture.</p>
<p>Sometime after the release of Tenderness, Sydette Sakauye left the band to pursue a solo career. Meri Pherson, who would later design and sew the group&#8217;s outfits, replaced her.</p>
<p>Â· Me Japanese Boy (I Love You) LP (Delilah Records, 1973)</p>
<p>The peppy title track of their third album, which was credited to &#8220;Liz Damon with the Orient Express,&#8221; was written by Bacharach-David. Bobby Goldsboro took the song to #74 in August 1964, and the Pizzicato Five covered it on a 1998 release. LDOE&#8217;s version hit #1 in Hawaii; though it was more popular on a local level than &#8220;1900,&#8221; it failed to chart nationally.</p>
<p>Four of the record&#8217;s other ten cuts were penned by the loathsome Neil Sedaka, including the follow-up single, &#8220;I&#8217;m a Song (Sing Me).&#8221; They also covered Stevie Wonder&#8217;s hit from the previous year, &#8220;You Are the Sunshine of My Life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heaven in My Heart LP (Domi Doncy Records, 1978)</p>
<p>Liz herself wrote the title track of their fourth album, which also included the traditional Hawaiian song &#8220;More Better Go Easy&#8221; and Nat &#8220;King&#8221; Cole&#8217;s &#8220;Unforgettable.&#8221; The rest of the record pretty much consists of international standards like &#8220;Canadian Sunset,&#8221; &#8220;Danny Boy,&#8221; &#8220;Chanson d&#8217;Amour&#8221; and Antonio Carlos Jobim&#8217;s &#8220;Wave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the back cover credits the &#8220;producer&#8221; as an international travel company, Cartan Tours, whose chairman wrote the liner notes. With a group taking the name of a famous railroad and performing songs about faraway lands, Cartan apparently thought the record would inspire listeners to book overseas vacations. This is the band&#8217;s most solid long-player.</p>
<p>Â· WARNING: This Album Could be HAZARDOUS to Your Ego! LP (Domi Doncy Records, 1979)</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked Edda to record some of her favorite stories and little jokes,&#8221; Liz wrote in the liner notes to this, her sister&#8217;s debut comedy album. Edda obviously did. Apparently the band cutup, Edda&#8217;s side project includes bits called &#8220;The Job Interview,&#8221; &#8220;The Chicken,&#8221; &#8220;The Airplane,&#8221; &#8220;First Man on the Sun&#8221; and &#8220;Kanimotoshita&#8217;s Department Store.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t heard this one, so I can&#8217;t say whether it&#8217;s actually funny.</p>
<p>Â· At the Lion&#8217;s Den Lounge, Reno MGM video (bootleg, 1983)</p>
<p>The entirety of this unedited tape is shot in a single, continuous 45-minute take, panning across the stage and zooming in and out on the Orient Express in full-tilt performance. The front line of Liz, Edda and Meri dance with synchronized, Jazzercise-style moves. Liz, with her enormous fake eyelashes, wears a sparkling orange blouse with matching slacks, while Edda and Meri wear black versions of the same. They all wear high heels.</p>
<p>The four-man backup band had only one Asian guy, the guitarist, down from the original six Asians with which they started out. With the bass player, drummer and keyboard player all haoles, they might&#8217;ve changed their name to Liz Damon&#8217;s Coast Starlight.</p>
<p>This live show, which includes lots of banter with the receptive audience, is much more rocking than any of their recorded material (from which they didn&#8217;t draw a single song). The set opens with a cover of Toto&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;ll Supply the Love,&#8221; followed by Paul Simon&#8217;s gospel-influenced &#8220;Gone at Last&#8221; and a medley of Sly and the Family Stone&#8217;s &#8220;Dance To the Music&#8221; and Martha Reeves&#8217; &#8220;Dancing in the Street.&#8221; Edda, who cracks jokes about men who don&#8217;t put down the toilet seat, does some silly number about drinking too much tequila, and the drummer sings Lionel Ritchie&#8217;s lame hit &#8220;You Are.&#8221; After concluding with another medley of songs which I didn&#8217;t recognize, Liz introduced the individual band members, then announced they&#8217;d be back for late shows at 9:45 and 12:15.</p>
<p>Also on the video are a couple interview segments from local Reno news broadcasts. In the first one, Edda the jokester looks like Joan Jett, wearing sunglasses, a torn sweatshirt, leather pants and a spiked wristband (at least I think she was goofing around). The second segment shows live footage of the group performing Dolly Parton&#8217;s &#8220;9 to 5,&#8221; with the singers wearing gold lamÃ© outfits and headbands like John Travolta in Stayin&#8217; Alive.</p>
<p>The Orient Express also took their lounge act to Las Vegas-where they played a Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon-as well as Lake Tahoe, Atlantic City, Puerto Rico, Canada and Japan.</p>
<p>After the group disbanded in the mid-&#8217;80s, Edda moved to New Jersey, married, had a couple of kids and currently works as drama coach for children. Meanwhile, Liz lives in Las Vegas with her husband and teenage son. She works at the Westward Ho as casino host and entertainment director, and still sings at private parties and conventions and coffee shops in the area. She plans to return to Hawaii someday.</p>
<p>All of the Orient Express&#8217; recordings are long out-of-print, except for &#8220;1900 Yesterday,&#8221; which is available on a few compilation CDs. Following hits by the Turtles, Lyme &amp; Cybelle and Nino &amp; April, the song closes out the 21-track label anthology Happy Together: The Very Best of White Whale Records (VarÃ¨se Sarabande, 1999). Otherwise, the marginal Top-40 hit has long since fallen through the cracks, and the group never charted again. Still, while Liz Damon&#8217;s Orient Express goes down in music history as just another one-hit wonder, what a wonderful hit it was.</p>
<p>Mahalo to Shelley Hinatsu for her valuable assistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Last of the Freaks: The Carl Franzoni Story as told to John Trubee</p>
<p> In 1973 I bought the Freak Out! double LP by the Mothers of Invention at a little record shop on Palmer Square in my hometown, Princeton, NJ. Its first song, &quot;Hungry Freaks, Daddy,&quot; was written for someone named Carl Orestes Franzoni who, according to Zappa&#8217;s liner notes, &quot;is freaky down to his toe nails. Someday he will live next door to you and your lawn will die.&quot; The lyrics decried America&#8217;s culture of mindless conformity and consumerism, with lines like:</p>
<p> &quot;Mister America walk on by your schools that do not teach<br /> Mister America walk on by the minds that won&#8217;t be reached<br /> Mister America try to hide the emptiness that&#8217;s you inside<br /> When once you find the way you lied <br /> And all the corny tricks you tried<br /> Will not forestall the rising tide of HUNGRY FREAKS, DADDY!&quot;</p>
<p> This song became the anthem of my alienated and disenfranchised youth. I carried its lyrics around in my head for years.</p>
<p> Across the continent and nearly three decades later, I wandered across the campus at Santa Rosa Junior College in Santa Rosa, CA. It was May 2001. I headed into the student lounge to check out an art exhibit and noticed a strange-looking older man sitting on a sofa. He had short pants, leather vest, a leather hat festooned with various buttons, tattoos covering his arms and other exposed flesh, assorted wrist bracelets, beaded necklaces, and a presence that screamed that he had seen and done much in his life. One aging earth mother hippie-type woman was introducing him to another, asking &quot;And have you met my friend Carl Franzoni?&quot; My ears pricked up. A little later I walked over and introduced myself to Mr. Franzoni and it turned out that he was indeed the one for whom &quot;Hungry Freaks, Daddy&quot; was written. I was privileged to get better acquainted with Carl after that. He&#8217;s 68 and today lives in Santa Rosa. His has been a colorful life-a young hood from Cincinnati who reformed, relocated to San Francisco in the late &#8217;50s, then gravitated to LA and, with Vito Paulekas, was a dancer/scenester/catalyst in the explosion of music, psychedelia, and mayhem on the Sunset Strip in the mid 1960s. Franzoni toured as a dancer with the Byrds and the Mothers of Invention in both bands&#8217; early days. </p>
<p> I interviewed Franzoni at his artifact-strewn apartment on Sunday evening, November 17th, 2002.</p>
<p> SCRAM: I&#8217;d like to start when you first arrived in LA and were involved in a mail order business.<br /> CARL: My first job was Cecelia Desteffano of Hollywood. My partner was a guy named Joe. He brought me to Hollywood. There was a man I worked for in Menlo Park/Redwood City up in the Bay Area. They said to me, &quot;Do you wanna get into a business?&quot; I had a girlfriend that I met in a twist club, Cecelia. She had three children and a husband and lived in Menlo Park. She was tired because her husband was just a straight guy and there was no &quot;oomph!&quot; in her life. She was a really good-looking woman, very Italian-looking. Well, I had a lot of girlfriends in that twist place-the Peppermint Lounge in Redwood City. Cecelia came in there one night, so I said, &quot;Why don&#8217;t you come over to my place sometime?&quot; My brother John and I were home and she knocked on the door and I said to John, &quot;Take a walk.&quot; I got her in the bedroom and I&#8217;m taking her apart. Now she was really the old style woman: she wore a girdle, panties, her girdle held up her stockings, high heeled shoes, always made up really well like a secretary-and she was just a homemaker. So I took her apart. What I mean by that was that in order to fuck her I had to go through the girdle and go through the panties-but I got her. And she got off like she had never gotten off. Three kids and she&#8217;d never gotten off with this guy. She was married for twelve years with him. I had other girlfriends, but she wasn&#8217;t gonna let me alone. And I like her a lot. I have an Italian thing anyway. If a woman&#8217;s Italian&#8230; So my friend Joe said, &#8216;&quot;My mother has got a thing for her tits. If you come and talk to her you&#8217;ll see that my mother who&#8217;s 56 or 57 has got tits like Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s.&quot;<br /> SCRAM: Was this about 1960?<br /> CARL: No, this was &#8217;61 or &#8217;62. I went and met his mother. She was in her yard. I remember there was a low picket fence and she came out and she was watering or something. And I&#8217;m looking at this woman and I&#8217;m thinking, &quot;How in the hell did she get tits like that?&quot;<br /> SCRAM: Were they big, or pointy, or what? <br /> CARL: They were like a young woman&#8217;s breasts. So I asked Joe, &quot;How did this happen?&quot; He says, &quot; She sent to Milan, because she heard there was a bust-developer there that works.&quot; We sent for one. The mail order house sent back a bell jar with a tube and an atomizer. Very simple idea. Today if it was used it would ruin the business of breast implants. I used it on my own chest and it blew up into the bell jar. All you have to do is do ten or fifteen minutes with this bell jar daily, and it&#8217;ll work! It stretches your tissues and it&#8217;s like a super exercise.<br /> SCRAM: The blood comes in and fills up the tissues? <br /> CARL: And you&#8217;re amazed by it. Then we got another thing from that idea and it was for the penis- the penis pump. But it never worked like the other did. So Cecelia Desteffano sells her house because she wants to come to Hollywood with me, and she fronts the business. We all moved to LA, including Cecelia and her daughter. The two boys stayed with her husband. My partner&#8217;s name was Scallacci, Joe Scallacci-the same name as the famous murderer Scallacci. Probably from the same family. I think they were Sicilian. <br /> SCRAM: Where was your mail order business office? <br /> CARL: My office was on Melrose Avenue. Not the Melrose Avenue where all the shit&#8217;s going on right now. Vito did one of his first things there and the band Love came out of Melrose Avenue. It was west of Fairfax, not east of Fairfax on Melrose.<br /> SCRAM: Were the sales of penis pumps very good?<br /> CARL: Well, yes. The bust developer was very successful, but we could never find enough names [sales leads from mail order lists]. I think there was one other company that had the breast pump, but they didn&#8217;t know how to advertise it like we did. What we did was mail a pink folder to women. It looked very personal. We used Cecelia&#8217;s picture. She was very voluptuous, good-looking, very Italian-looking girl, like somebody from Cleveland. Black raven hair and big brown eyes. I had these partners, but Cecelia put up the money. She had her money from her divorce so she could afford a nice apartment for us right off of Third Street, then she moved to south off Sepulveda with a 4-bedroom apartment. She had her girlfriend with her, who Joe liked, so it was like we were a foursome. One day I&#8217;m with Joe and we&#8217;re having lunch on Sunset Boulevard and we go to this place called Ben Frank&#8217;s. It&#8217;s still there, a modernistic-looking place. We&#8217;re sitting there and there&#8217;s three hippie kind of girls-but there&#8217;s not hippies yet. We&#8217;re businessmen and they&#8217;re bohemians. Now I had been in North Beach with the beatniks before I went to LA, so maybe these were beatnik women. They wore crazy clothes, not like the usual, and they way that they painted themselves was very different. So we&#8217;re having lunch, talking, and I&#8217;m looking at this girl and she&#8217;s small and has black hair and brown eyes-she&#8217;s Italian. I know it, okay? So I said to Joe-he knows, he&#8217;s Italian himself-&quot;let&#8217;s go over before we go and talk to them.&quot; I said, &quot;Listen, I&#8217;m looking at you from across the room and I&#8217;d like to speak to you or get involved with you somehow. Is that possible?&quot; And she said, &quot;Yes! I&#8217;m a painter and I&#8217;m painting at Vito&#8217;s studio, he&#8217;s my mentor. Would you come and see my paintings and I&#8217;ll introduce you to my friend Vito?&quot; And as I&#8217;m walking away she said &quot;And bring your friend.&quot; Her name was Mary Mancini. Joe and I decided to go there. <br /> SCRAM: Where was Vito&#8217;s studio?<br /> CARL: 303 North Laurel, at Beverly. Eastman&#8217;s Gym is upstairs. It&#8217;s a funky dress shop with sculptures in the windows. We go in and then make a sharp right and see a fluorescent light in the basement. We go down and it&#8217;s like no place you&#8217;ve ever been. It&#8217;s like if you opened a Mayan tomb, with little things painted all over the walls. Then you see half-done sculpture, and there are two painters sitting there. One of them is this woman Mary Mancini. She was a schoolteacher &#8212; but they couldn&#8217;t let her teach, because the girls at the Catholic school where she worked liked her too much and she liked them. She had lesbianism going within her world and she was also a whore. I was interested in her painting and I bought the first one I saw there. I paid $350 for it. I was trying to get in her pants, true, but after a while that wasn&#8217;t the object because I saw her predicament. I took her into our business. I told the other guys about her and they made her their secretary. She found me a secretary that was very Catholic and I told her that if I had a secretary I was gonna fuck her. So she&#8217;d better get ready. The one she got was a Chicano girl and she couldn&#8217;t stand me-so I said &quot;Mary, I&#8217;ve got to get another secretary, and I don&#8217;t want her to be upset with me because I&#8217;m interested in her and she&#8217;s not.&quot; So she went off got me another secretary who I married. Cecelia Desteffano was gone by now.<br /> SCRAM: What happened to her?<br /> CARL: She tried to commit suicide because I wouldn&#8217;t pay attention to her anymore. I tried to bring her into Vito&#8217;s scene and get her to understand my life was changing. I wasn&#8217;t a dancer yet, but I was going to dance classes, and I was finding that thing with a group of people.<br /> SCRAM: Were you dancing at Vito&#8217;s studio?<br /> CARL: Well, no. He had time in the Coronet Theater on La Cienega Boulevard, and upstairs there was dance studio. People that were in West Side Story used the facility. The main guy dancer from that film, we would comp off of each other. He would see what we were doing and we&#8217;d see what he was doing. Both of the classes were really good. We&#8217;d watch each other for a while, but you can&#8217;t stay in a dance class very long. They want you to get out. They don&#8217;t want you to steal from them. Anyway, I&#8217;m doing this stuff and Cecelia doesn&#8217;t want to go along with it. She wants me to be a straight businessman. To me it was boring because I was seeing and finding other things. La Dolce Vita was in theatrical release at the time, all those Swedish movies, and Fellini. If you saw those movies, it would change your life. Plus, all the artists that were coming to Vito&#8217;s place: Richard Avedon, Bert Schoenberg (who had done paintings on Sunset Boulevard), Valerie Porter, who was to became my girlfriend later. It was becoming a grand scene. Before I showed up Vito had a lot of movie stars that would come there and sculpt. Joe De Santis and Jonathan Winters and Mickey Rooney. Vito would hang out with them. Once in a while I&#8217;ll see these guys on TV. The movie Around the World in 80 Days has most of these people that Vito knew at this time. Anyway, Cecelia couldn&#8217;t make the grade. I get a phone call and she&#8217;s in the hospital from a suicide attempt. I go to the hospital and I look at her and I go &quot;Listen girl, lemme tell you something. You got three kids. You don&#8217;t have to fuckin&#8217; kill yourself for me. What the fuck am I? Don&#8217;t think that you have to do anything like that? Why are you ending your life? You&#8217;re a beautiful woman!&quot; I kind of yelled at her. &quot;It&#8217;s just the end of a thing. We can&#8217;t make it. You&#8217;re not interested in what I&#8217;m interested in.&quot; So it was cool. She had given me a brand new MG two-seater sports car, and I gave it back to her. I said, &quot;I can&#8217;t accept this car from you because our love affair is over.&quot; <br /> SCRAM: You told me that when you first met Vito and his crew you&#8217;d just go to watch them dance, but you just hung back and didn&#8217;t dance for the first six months?<br /> CARL: Yeah, for about three to six months I just went with them to different places. We went to a rock &#8216;n&#8217;roll place on Fairfax Avenue and I would just kinda peek in, but I wasn&#8217;t ready to dance yet. Then we switched places to [the Purple Onion on] Sunset Boulevard where Bert Schoenberg had that billboard outside, that painting of a sunburst or whatever the hell it was. He was really famous in Hollywood at the time. Everybody wanted to own a Bert Schoenberg painting. It was a very funky place, right across the street from Ralph&#8217;s on Sunset Boulevard near La Brea. I started dancing in there; I just let it go. Also my answering service was near there-yeah, everybody had to have an answering service&#8230;<br /> SCRAM: That&#8217;s something from a bygone era. Now everyone has answering machines or digital voicemail. How weird.<br /> CARL: Yeah, it cost you a fortune.<br /> SCRAM: When you did your business you gave people the phone number for your answering service and they&#8217;d leave a message with an operator? That seems like the dark ages now.<br /> CARL: Right. Anyway, that was where I really got into the dance. Then we moved to the Whisky. There were no white bands yet. There were black bands and only black bands-Motown and that stuff was just hummin&#8217;. And Elvis Presley was just barely Elvis Presley. He was still a kid, y&#8217;know. There were no clubs on Sunset Boulevard. There was nothing there. Further down there were two clubs-there was that place at Vine and Sunset, it&#8217;s still there, the Palladium. And across the street from that was where they shot the old TV show Queen For A Day, the Aquarius Theater. The Palladium is where the black bands played the most. Then Gazzari&#8217;s was open, and then there was one that was run by this woman who owned the Body Shop-[The Galaxy.] That&#8217;s where Tina Turner and the Iron Butterfly turned out. It was up near the Whisky. And then there was this little tiny club where the Doors played for three months [the London Fog]-nobody even thought about them. Somebody from the Whisky came over, &#8217;cause the Whisky was turning. The Whisky was straight, it was just a dance club. It was women in the box. Frank Zappa had to play a straight number to get in there. They would yell at him if he played something crazy. There were no Byrds, no Buffalo Springfield, there was nothing. They were in incubation in the garage, all of them. Back in Hollywood we were dancing to records or R&amp;B black bands. They got pushed out of Hollywood because of the white music. We would dance to whatever they had. The dancers Vito had at his class would go out at night. We&#8217;d have a destination; we would meet there. We would go out a couple of times a week and then it got more frequent. We became more and more popular and each club vied for our attention because if we would go there the club would become famous.<br /> SCRAM: Because you brought all this energy and all these people&#8230;<br /> CARL: And brought a dance that nobody else had ever seen. We were giving an original dance here. These were artists that were dancing. We were doing an art form.<br /> SCRAM: How large was your average group of people with whom you&#8217;d go out to the clubs?<br /> CARL: Well, I&#8217;d say no less than ten, but I remember one time when Herbie Cohen let us into the Shrine Auditorium, he let a hundred of us dancers in there. He counted us as we went in; Frank Zappa&#8217;s on the stage. But the band we most liked to dance to was the Gauchos. The Gauchos were from Fresno. I tell people about the Gauchos all the time. They were an eleven-piece band with horns. They did &quot;La Bamba&quot; like nobody else-they put &quot;La Bamba&quot; on the map because they had brass for it. They were a tight band, they wore uniforms and when you danced to them you got so fucking high from it. I remember the club that was the Playboy Club-we shredded it! We were dancing on the bar and we were dancing on the tables. The place was almost ready to come apart! Anyway, that&#8217;s what was going on in Hollywood at that moment until somebody said &quot;Listen, there&#8217;s a band that needs a job.&quot;<br /> SCRAM: Are you referring to the Byrds?<br /> CARL: That was the Byrds. They were a bunch of funky asshole dudes; they didn&#8217;t know what to do with themselves. They had gone to San Francisco and had all of their equipment stolen out of their station wagon, which was parked out in front of the club. They had their tires stolen. They came out and there was nothing there. The thieves had ripped that thing to shreds.</p>
